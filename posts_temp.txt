2	Adulthood and Maturity	adulthood-and-maturity	article/2014/03/11/1/adulthood-and-maturity	<p>Children are always watching their parents. I remember watching my dad as he watched the nightly news on TV. I would sit there and think, “Why would you watch the news when you could watch cartoons? When I’m an adult, I’m going to stay up late and watch cartoons.”</p>    <figure>      <img alt="Looney Tunes logo" src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2014-03-11-looney-tunes.png">      <figcaption>Looney Tunes title card</figcaption>  </figure>    <p>That was many moons ago. The older I get, the more I look back at my past self and realize how immature I was (I Cor. 13:11). But I’ve never thought that I was immature; it’s always past Brian that was immature. Of course, a few years later, I realize that what I thought was mature was still young and immature (this time I really am mature though!).</p>    <p>The same goes with “old”. There’s a direct correlation between my age and my definition of “old”. I remember in grade school thinking high schoolers were old. Now I lump high schoolers in to the “kids” designation. The same cycle with college students and college graduates. Now my definition of old is “has grandchildren”, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be changing that definition eventually.</p>    <p>I assume that this cycle continues your whole life. You never feel old, but you always feel mature. You never feel like you know exactly what to do next. And yet, somewhere along the way you become an adult, though there’s not a day where you wake up and think, “Now I’m an adult.” </p>    <p>When I was planning my last vacation, I stopped and thought, “This is something my parents did. When they were my age. My parents were just like me.” And it hit me: adults just make it up as they go along. Nobody knows exactly what to do next; everyone gives it their best shot, but nobody <em>knows</em>. And you might never feel like an adult: because you thought adults were so different from you, you expected to feel differently when it happened to you. But you won’t. Everyone is just making it up as they go along.</p>    <p>But I <em>am</em> an adult. I make decisions. I plan vacations. I’m responsible for people other than myself. I can choose whether to watch the news or cartoons. And now that I’ve reached that point, now that I am an adult, now that I can choose…I stay up late and watch cartoons. Because why would you watch the news when you could watch cartoons? 😉</p>	<p>Chil­dren are al­ways watch­ing their par­ents. I re­mem­ber watch­ing my dad as he watched the nightly news on TV. I would sit there and think, “Why would you watch the news when you could watch car­toons? When I’m an adult, I’m go­ing to stay up late and watch car­toons.”</p>  <figure>      <img alt="Looney Tunes logo" src="/img/journal/looney-tunes.png">      <figcaption>Looney Tunes title card</figcaption>  </figure>    <p>That was many moons ago. The older I get, the more I look back at my past self and re­al­ize how im­ma­ture I was (I Cor. 13:11). But I’ve never thought that I was im­ma­ture; it’s al­ways past Brian that was im­ma­ture. Of course, a few years later, I re­al­ize that what I thought was ma­ture was still young and im­ma­ture (this time I re­ally am ma­ture though!).</p>  <p>The same goes with “old”. There’s a di­rect cor­re­la­tion be­tween my age and my de­f­i­n­i­tion of “old”. I re­mem­ber in grade school think­ing high school­ers were old. Now I lump high school­ers in to the “kids” des­ig­na­tion. The same cy­cle with col­lege stu­dents and col­lege grad­u­ates. Now my de­f­i­n­i­tion of old is “has grand­chil­dren”, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be chang­ing that de­f­i­n­i­tion even­tu­ally.</p>  <p>I as­sume that this cy­cle con­tin­ues your whole life. You never feel old, but you al­ways feel ma­ture. You never feel like you know ex­actly what to do next. And yet, some­where along the way you be­come an adult, though there’s not a day where you wake up and think, “Now I’m an adult.” </p>  <p>When I was plan­ning my last va­ca­tion, I stopped and thought, “This is some­thing my par­ents did. When they were my age. My par­ents were just like me.” And it hit me: adults just make it up as they go along. No­body knows ex­actly what to do next; every­one gives it their best shot, but no­body <em>knows</em>. And you might never feel like an adult: be­cause you thought adults were so dif­fer­ent from you, you ex­pected to feel dif­fer­ently when it hap­pened to you. But you won’t. Every­one is just mak­ing it up as they go along.</p>  <p>But I <em>am</em> an adult. I make de­ci­sions. I plan va­ca­tions. I’m re­spon­si­ble for peo­ple other than my­self. I can choose whether to watch the news or car­toons. And now that I’ve reached that point, now that I am an adult, now that I can choose…I stay up late and watch car­toons. Be­cause why would you watch the news when you could watch car­toons? ??</p>	<p>Children are always watching their parents. I remember watching my dad as he watched the nightly news on TV.

3	Christmas Letter 2014	christmas-letter-2014	article/2014/12/25/1/christmas-letter-2014	<p>Merry Christmas 2014!</p>  <p>Greetings to all our dear family and friends! We’ve had quite a full year, most of it fun-filled, and we praise the Lord for His goodness throughout every moment of it. Since this was our last year of working at PCC, January through June was marked by how many times we could have friends and campus kids over before we went our separate ways. One fun landmark was in April: we threw a computer-themed surprise birthday party for Brian and had a blast! Many thanks to those who came and made it such a special day.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2014-04-12-brians-birthday.jpg" alt="Photo from Brian’s birthday party 2014">      <figcaption>Friends at the birthday party</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>In June we launched a small dream of ours: a recipe website, at <a href="http://koser.us/recipes">koser.us/?recipes</a>! Currently it only contains Melissa’s recipes, and the design is very basic, but in the coming years we’ll continue to make improvements. In the meantime, feel free to browse for ideas (or just for fun!).</p>  <p>It’s been a pleasure working with such fine folk at PCC, and we do miss the good work atmosphere. Brian enjoyed working in children’s church at PCC, and Melissa misses playing in the church orchestra. We also enjoyed attending a Couples’ Bible Study, taught by Dr. Dale Adkins. Our last day of work at PCC was July 18th, and we moved out the very next day. We praise the Lord for His grace in holding off the rain as we loaded the truck. Huge thanks (again!) for everyone that made it a short move—45 minutes to load the truck, and another 15 minutes to finish cleaning the house. Several of our friends also drove to our new house in Mobile, AL and helped us unload everything into the new apartment.</p>  <p>Some of our friends got married this year (woohoo!). In July we attended the wedding of Jonathan and Janae Sparks, and in August that of Andrew and Carrie Olsen. Since then, we’ve been able to keep (somewhat) in contact with our campus kids at PCC, and roughly once a month we are able to bring Megan Koser over for a weekend of relaxation.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2014-07-05-sparks-wedding.jpg" alt="Jonathan and Janae Sparks at their wedding reception">      <figcaption>Jonathan &amp; Janae Sparks at their wedding reception</figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2014-08-13-andrew-olsen-wedding.jpg" alt="Andrew Olsen">      <figcaption>Andrew Olsen…one of his better pictures 😉</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>God has led us to <a href="http://www.crossroadsbaptistmobile.com">Crossroads Baptist Church</a>, a wonderful church with caring people. The fellowship meals each month have helped us in getting to know our new church family, and already we feel right at home! There are also many service opportunities, and we’re excited to see what the Lord will do in this ministry.</p>  <p>These later months have been full of family (always a good thing!). In October we got to spend a few days with Melissa’s parents, as well as introduce them to our church family. In November we spent Thanksgiving with nearly all of Brian’s family, and we enjoyed watching Megan Koser perform in Pirates of Penzance at PCC.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2014-11-29-pcc-with-danny.jpg" alt="Danny Koser">      <figcaption>Danny, Brian’s 21-month-old brother</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>December has so far been a busy month with decorating, making goodies, preparing for a piano recital, and making more goodies.

4	Top Ten Punctuation Marks	top-ten-punctuation-marks	article/2015/10/24/1/top-ten-punctuation-marks	<p>I like punctuation marks. Why? Well…maybe because they shape language so much while going mostly unnoticed. Maybe because they’re never spoken* and their names are unknown to laymen, giving them a mysterious air. Probably just because they look nice. Here’s my favorite ten, from 10 to 1.</p>    <h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>    <h3 id="-span-class-giga-span-obelus"><span class="giga">÷</span> Obelus</h3>    <h3 id="-span-class-giga-span-solidus"><span class="giga">/</span> Solidus</h3>    <p>How cool are the names “obelus” and “solidus”? Answer: very.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-braces"><span class="giga">{}</span> Braces</h2>    <p>[More graceful than stodgy brackets.] (More refined than the common parentheses.) {Braces are the Audrey Hepburn of the punctuation world.}</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-ellipsis"><span class="giga">…</span> Ellipsis</h2>    <p>Not three periods. See the difference? </p>    <p><span>…</span> (ellipsis) <br>  <span>...</span> (three periods)</p>    <p>What do you mean, what difference does it make? Pistols at dawn, sir!</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-pipe"><span class="giga">?</span> Pipe</h2>    <p>I don’t really use the pipe. I’m not really sure what the pipe is for. But I feel safer knowing the pipe is there in case I ever need it.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-ampersand"><span class="giga">&amp;</span> Ampersand</h2>    <p>So the name “ampersand” comes from when “&amp;” was included at the end of the alphabet, so you would say, “X Y Z, and, per se, ‘and’” because if you said “X Y Z and ‘and’” it would sound awkward, and so the Latin phrase “per se” was added…and then it was abbreviated over time…part of the alphabet…fine, I’ll stop. Anyway, look at that swoop! Chic.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-asterisk"><span class="giga">*</span> Asterisk</h2>    <p>Some refer to the asterisk as the “splat”, which, though lacking respect, is still preferrable to “aster<strong>ick</strong>”. (To those “asterick”-sayers: please note the second “S”. And please note my stern disapproval.) My favorite asterisk is the one in the typeface Source Code Pro: <span style="font-family:'Source Code Pro'">*</span> I don’t know why, but it makes me smile every time.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-guillemet"><span class="giga">»</span> Guillemet</h2>    <p>My college English 101 professor mentioned that she used this symbol when taking notes to indicate a definition. That advice is the single-most life-changing advice—related to note-taking—I have ever received (thanks Mrs. Twigg!). Just one reason the dashing guillemet deserves a more prominent spot in our language.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-cent-sign"><span class="giga">¢</span> Cent sign</h2>    <p>What makes the cent sign so beautiful? Is it the sublime combination of curve and straight? The swelling of nostalgia for the days of newspapers and horse-drawn carriages and top hats? The reminder of the Horatio Alger-esque rags-to-riches tales which have inspired our nation since its founding? Whatever the reason, it occupies a special place in my heart.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-section-sign"><span class="giga">§</span> Section sign</h2>    <p>It’s a crime that the section sign is not seen in more literature. We’ve sacrificed the section sign and its milieu for the sake of clarity, of conciseness. Instead of “ch. 3, § 102(a)(1), para. 4, subp. 13” we use the banal, mechanical, and sensible “1.3.1”. But at what cost to our souls? The section sign is overwrought, archaic, pretentious…and wonderful.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-pilcrow"><span class="giga">¶</span> Pilcrow</h2>    <p>Ah, the pilcrow; know today chiefly as Microsoft Word’s formatting marks icon. Best named of all punctuation. But mere words will not suffice, so I give to you a montage of pilcrows:</p>    <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2015-10-24-pilcrows.png">  </figure>  <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-question-mark"><span class="giga">?</span> Question mark</h2>    <p>Unlike its workaday brother the period, the question mark does not wear out its welcome with overly-frequent visits. Unlike its melodramatic sister the exclamation mark, it does not stay out all night partying and then bang around the house obnoxiously when arriving home. The question mark is the cat that you almost forget is living with you; it occupies a happy medium, familiar but not constantly present.</p>    <p>Its functional precision is matched by its form. The curves of the question mark speak of mystery, of the great unknown, of the riddles we ponder on stormy nights. The question mark bypasses the mind and the heart, and speaks directly to the soul.

What more could you ask from a bit of punctuation? ?</p>    <p>* Well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=victor+borge+phonetic+punctuation">almost never</a>.</p>	NULL	<p>I like punctuation marks. Why? Well…maybe because they shape language so much while going mostly unnoticed. Maybe because they’re never spoken* and their names are unknown to laymen, giving them a mysterious air. Probably just because they look nice. Here’s my favorite ten, from 10 to 1.</p>    <h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>    <h3 id="-span-class-giga-span-obelus"><span class="giga">÷</span> Obelus</h3>    <h3 id="-span-class-giga-span-solidus"><span class="giga">/</span> Solidus</h3>    <p>How cool are the names “obelus” and “solidus”? Answer: very.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-braces"><span class="giga">{}</span> Braces</h2>    <p>[More graceful than stodgy brackets.] (More refined than the common parentheses.) {Braces are the Audrey Hepburn of the punctuation world.}</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-ellipsis"><span class="giga">…</span> Ellipsis</h2>    <p>Not three periods. See the difference? </p>    <p><span>…</span> (ellipsis) <br>  <span>...</span> (three periods)</p>    <p>What do you mean, what difference does it make? Pistols at dawn, sir!</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-pipe"><span class="giga">?</span> Pipe</h2>    <p>I don’t really use the pipe. I’m not really sure what the pipe is for. But I feel safer knowing the pipe is there in case I ever need it.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-ampersand"><span class="giga">&amp;</span> Ampersand</h2>    <p>So the name “ampersand” comes from when “&amp;” was included at the end of the alphabet, so you would say, “X Y Z, and, per se, ‘and’” because if you said “X Y Z and ‘and’” it would sound awkward, and so the Latin phrase “per se” was added…and then it was abbreviated over time…part of the alphabet…fine, I’ll stop. Anyway, look at that swoop! Chic.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-asterisk"><span class="giga">*</span> Asterisk</h2>    <p>Some refer to the asterisk as the “splat”, which, though lacking respect, is still preferrable to “aster<strong>ick</strong>”. (To those “asterick”-sayers: please note the second “S”. And please note my stern disapproval.) My favorite asterisk is the one in the typeface Source Code Pro: <span style="font-family:'Source Code Pro'">*</span> I don’t know why, but it makes me smile every time.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-guillemet"><span class="giga">»</span> Guillemet</h2>    <p>My college English 101 professor mentioned that she used this symbol when taking notes to indicate a definition. That advice is the single-most life-changing advice—related to note-taking—I have ever received (thanks Mrs. Twigg!). Just one reason the dashing guillemet deserves a more prominent spot in our language.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-cent-sign"><span class="giga">¢</span> Cent sign</h2>    <p>What makes the cent sign so beautiful? Is it the sublime combination of curve and straight? The swelling of nostalgia for the days of newspapers and horse-drawn carriages and top hats? The reminder of the Horatio Alger-esque rags-to-riches tales which have inspired our nation since its founding? Whatever the reason, it occupies a special place in my heart.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-section-sign"><span class="giga">§</span> Section sign</h2>    <p>It’s a crime that the section sign is not seen in more literature. We’ve sacrificed the section sign and its milieu for the sake of clarity, of conciseness. Instead of “ch. 3, § 102(a)(1), para. 4, subp. 13” we use the banal, mechanical, and sensible “1.3.1”. But at what cost to our souls? The section sign is overwrought, archaic, pretentious…and wonderful.</p>    <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-pilcrow"><span class="giga">¶</span> Pilcrow</h2>    <p>Ah, the pilcrow; know today chiefly as Microsoft Word’s formatting marks icon. Best named of all punctuation. But mere words will not suffice, so I give to you a montage of pilcrows:</p>    <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2015-10-24-pilcrows.png">  </figure>  <h2 id="-span-class-giga-span-question-mark"><span class="giga">?</span> Question mark</h2>    <p>Unlike its workaday brother the period, the question mark does not wear out its welcome with overly-frequent visits. Unlike its melodramatic sister the exclamation mark, it does not stay out all night partying and then bang around the house obnoxiously when arriving home. The question mark is the cat that you almost forget is living with you; it occupies a happy medium, familiar but not constantly present.</p>    <p>Its functional precision is matched by its form. The curves of the question mark speak of mystery, of the great unknown, of the riddles we ponder on stormy nights. The question mark bypasses the mind and the heart, and speaks directly to the soul. It stands alone, not in the dusty library of Tedium or atop the mountain of Narcissism, but in the grey alleyway of Ambiguity, dimly lit by the flickering lamplight of Truth. The question mark is not a king or a fool or a workman. In the Kingdom of Punctuation, the question mark is the grand vizier, the power behind the throne, content to rule from the shadows.</p>    <p>The question mark works its craft with poise and panache.

It’s been another full and blessed year for us. January had an exciting start: when we returned from visiting Melissa’s family in Honduras, we discovered that a couple of rats had been using the apartment in our absence. The next few weeks were somewhat stressful as we washed and wiped everything that was out in the open, and learned to hide all our food. We were very glad to discover the rats had not gotten into any of our drawers or cupboards, which saved a ton of work. Eventually we found all their holes, sealed them, and managed to trap one rat and, er, remove its presence from the house.</p>    <p>In June we were privileged to host missionaries, the <a href="http://kingsinafrica.com/">Jason and Ashley King family</a>, during our church’s Missions Conference. We enjoyed getting to know them and the other missionaries. The conference was a great blessing and challenge, and ended with a BBQ/?cake/?pie bake-off at our church. Melissa placed third with her prize-winning Swiss Roll Cake, dethroning many previous champs. She looks forward to placing first next year.</p>    <p>We spent our summer vacation in Orlando, FL, attending the Dice Tower board gaming convention. For three days we enjoyed playing board games, meeting new people, participating in Dice Tower activities, and just being nerdy among others like us. We even got to play a couple games with one of the founding members of the Dice Tower! </p>    <figure>            <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2015-06-25-dice-tower-con.jpg" alt="Brian and Melissa at Dice Tower Convention with Sam and David Healey">            <figcaption>Dice Tower Con!

Melissa’s parents and sister were present for the birth, and Brian’s family arrived the day after. We also got to see Melissa’s Uncle Leland and Aunt Marty, and a week later her brother Dale and his family visited as well. It was a very exciting time, and we were so glad to see everyone!

6	2015 → 2016	2015-2016	article/2016/01/15/1/2015-2016	<p>Squishy goals are bad. When you set a goal, like a New Year’s resolution, it should be concrete. Instead of “I’m going to eat healthier” your goal should be something like “I’m going to eat under 2000 calories six days per week.” </p>  <p>My resolutions from 2015 concrete; does that mean I got everything done? Let’s see how I did:</p>  <ol>      <li>          <h2>Work on to do list before work in the mornings</h2>          <p>I was doing well here until Lydia was born. Since then I’ve been getting to bed later and haven’t been getting up early enough to do anything before work.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Exercise 5 days every week</h2>          <p>Same as above. I was exercising in the morning a couple days a week, but haven’t even once since Lydia arrived. I did play racquetball on weekends, but not as much as I’d like (my goal is twice a month).</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Daily Family Meetings</h2>          <p>I purposely delayed this one. Keep reading.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Make dent in To Do items</h2>          <p>I have a <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> board where I keep track of items I need to do. At the beginning of the week I’ll choose several to get done that week. I did make a dent, but I’m always coming up with more things I want to do. (I have too many hobbies.)</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>5 hours a week on websites</h2>          <p>              Did I really want to do 5 hours a week? I didn’t spend that much time, but I did:              <ul>                  <li>complete a small redesign of <a href="http://briankoser.com">briankoser.com</a></li>                  <li>completely re-write <a href="http://koser.us">koser.us</a> with a new back- and front-end</li>                  <li>make <a href="http://koser.us/antonio/">Antonio</a>, a small project for a few BGG users (No longer maintained. Move along.)</li>                  <li>start making <a href="http://github.com/briankoser/thomas">Thomas</a>, a board game ranking tool</li>              </ul>          </p>      </li>  </ol>  <p>So I’m going to count this as a success.</p>  <hr class="hr-placeholder">  <p>So apparently I’m not great at keeping New Year’s resolutions. Let’s see if I can do better this year. Keep me accountable! Since I had five resolutions in 2015, I have six for 2016:</p>  <ol>      <li>          <h2>Read 20 books (including at least 2 audio books)</h2>          <p>I read 9 books in 2015, and some of those were graphic novels. Lately I’ve been reading more online: technical blogs, political and sports news, board game forums, reddit. I also didn’t finish listening to the audio book I started, favoring podcasts instead. In 2016, I’d like to cut back on the online reading. Until I’ve listened to a couple audiobooks I’ll slow down the podcast pace. That way I can finish half the books that I’ve started, read some more that are sitting on the bookshelf, and listen to those I have on my phone.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Finish 9 epics</h2>          <p><a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum">Scrum</a> is a project planning system that I’ve used at work. I’ve borrowed some of the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/march/stories-versus-themes-versus-epics">scrum terminology</a> for my to-do lists. Quick items (done in a week or less) I call “stories”. A project made up of multiple stories I call an “epic”. I currently have 18 epics on my to do list, and I’d like to finish 9 in 2016.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>30 minutes a day, 21 days a month on to do list</h2>          <p>To work on those epics and other stories, I’m going to set aside a half hour per day for three weeks out of the month.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Blog once per month at briankoser.com and koser.us</h2>          <p>I’m going to start posting my non-programming writing on koser.us, which is probably where you’re reading this.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Family Meetings</h2>          <p>I had this as a goal last year and decided to postpone it until after Lydia was born. When she starts eating solid food and we start eating at the table again, we’re going to start having family meetings. We’ll be able to keep up with what’s getting done and what still needs to be done. We can keep each other accountable so we don’t keep putting off important things like getting our wills signed (oops!).</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Start a podcast</h2>          <p>I really enjoy the medium of podcasting. The switch from the “push” model of radio and television to the “pull” model of podcasts and web video is a huge improvement. In 2016 I’d like to start a podcast. I’ve got a few different ideas but haven’t decided which to follow through on yet.</p>      </li>  </ol>  <p>I want 2016 to be a year of getting things done, and the best way for me to make sure it happens is concrete goals and accountability. Let’s do it!</p>	NULL	<p>Squishy goals are bad. When you set a goal, like a New Year’s resolution, it should be concrete.

Let’s see if I can do better this year. Keep me accountable! Since I had five resolutions in 2015, I have six for 2016:</p>  <ol>      <li>          <h2>Read 20 books (including at least 2 audio books)</h2>          <p>I read 9 books in 2015, and some of those were graphic novels. Lately I’ve been reading more online: technical blogs, political and sports news, board game forums, reddit. I also didn’t finish listening to the audio book I started, favoring podcasts instead. In 2016, I’d like to cut back on the online reading. Until I’ve listened to a couple audiobooks I’ll slow down the podcast pace. That way I can finish half the books that I’ve started, read some more that are sitting on the bookshelf, and listen to those I have on my phone.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Finish 9 epics</h2>          <p><a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum">Scrum</a> is a project planning system that I’ve used at work. I’ve borrowed some of the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/march/stories-versus-themes-versus-epics">scrum terminology</a> for my to-do lists. Quick items (done in a week or less) I call “stories”. A project made up of multiple stories I call an “epic”. I currently have 18 epics on my to do list, and I’d like to finish 9 in 2016.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>30 minutes a day, 21 days a month on to do list</h2>          <p>To work on those epics and other stories, I’m going to set aside a half hour per day for three weeks out of the month.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Blog once per month at briankoser.com and koser.us</h2>          <p>I’m going to start posting my non-programming writing on koser.us, which is probably where you’re reading this.</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Family Meetings</h2>          <p>I had this as a goal last year and decided to postpone it until after Lydia was born. When she starts eating solid food and we start eating at the table again, we’re going to start having family meetings. We’ll be able to keep up with what’s getting done and what still needs to be done. We can keep each other accountable so we don’t keep putting off important things like getting our wills signed (oops!).</p>      </li>      <li>          <h2>Start a podcast</h2>          <p>I really enjoy the medium of podcasting. The switch from the “push” model of radio and television to the “pull” model of podcasts and web video is a huge improvement. In 2016 I’d like to start a podcast. I’ve got a few different ideas but haven’t decided which to follow through on yet.</p>      </li>  </ol>  <p>I want 2016 to be a year of getting things done, and the best way for me to make sure it happens is concrete goals and accountability. Let’s do it!</p>	Brian Koser’s 2016 New Year’s resolutions	2016-01-15 00:00:00.0000000 +00:00	1	NULL	Squishy goals are bad. When you set a goal, like a New Year’s res­o­lu­tion, it should be con­crete. In­stead of “I’m go­ing to eat health­ier” your goal should be some­thing like “I’m go­ing to eat un­der 2000 calo­ries six days per week.”	NULL	1	1	article	Article	articles	2	Brian	Brian Koser

We try for the highest quality possible; for content, of course, but also for the audio quality and editing. In case you want to start a podcast, or just do some intermediate audio recording and editing, I’m going to write a series of articles detailing how we do it. Let’s start with the equipment.</p>  <p>You can record audio on your smart phone or laptop, but high-quality audio requires better equipment.

23	The Magic Thread	magic-thread	article/2016/12/17/1/magic-thread	<p>Too often, people want what they want (or what they think they want, which is usually "happiness" in one form or another) right now. The irony of their impatience is that only by learning to wait, and by a willingness to accept the bad with the good, do we usually attain those things that are truly worthwhile. "He that can have patience, can have what he will," Benjamin Franklin told us, and this French tale bears him out.</p>    <hr class="hr-placeholder">      <p>Once there was a widow who had a son called Peter. He was a strong, able boy, but he did not enjoy going to school and he was forever daydreaming.</p>  <p>"Peter, what are you dreaming about this time?" his teacher would say to him.</p>  <p>"I’m thinking about what I’ll be when I grow up," Peter replied.</p>  <p>"Be patient. There’s plenty of time for that. Being grown up isn’t all fun, you know," his teacher said.</p>  <p>But Peter found it hard to enjoy whatever he was doing at the moment, and was always hankering after the next thing. In winter he longed for it to be summer again, and in summer he looked forward to the skating, sledging, and warm fires of winter. At school he would long for the day to be over so that he could go home, and on Sunday nights he would sigh, "If only the holidays would come." What he enjoyed most was playing with his friend Liese. She was as good a companion as any boy, and no matter how impatient Peter was, she never took offense. "When I grow up, I shall marry Liese," Peter said to himself.</p>  <p>Often he wandered through the forest, dreaming of the future. Sometimes he lay down on the soft forest floor in the warm sun, his hands behind his head, staring up at the sky through the distant treetops. One hot afternoon as he began to grow sleepy, he heard someone calling his name. He opened his eyes and sat up. Standing before him was an old woman. In her hand she held a silver ball, from which dangled a silken golden thread.</p>  <p>"See what I have got here, Peter," she said, offering the ball to him.</p>  <p>"What is it?" he asked curiously, touching the fine golden thread.</p>  <p>"This is your life thread," the old woman replied. "Do not touch it and time will pass normally. But if you wish time to pass more quickly, you have only to pull the thread a little way and an hour will pass like a second. But I warn you, once the thread has been pulled out, it cannot be pushed back in again. It will disappear like a puff of smoke. The ball is for you. But if you accept my gift you must tell no one, or on that very day you shall die. Now, say, do you want it?"</p>  <p>Peter seized the gift from her joyfully. It was just what he wanted. He examined the silver ball. It was light and solid, made of a single piece. The only flaw in it was the tiny hole from which the bright thread hung. He put the ball in his pocket and ran home. There, making sure that his mother was out, he examined it again. The thread seemed to be creeping very slowly out of the ball, so slowly that it was scarcely noticeable to the naked eye. He longed to give it a quick tug, but dared not do so. Not yet.</p>  <p>The following day at school, Peter sat daydreaming about what he would do with his magic thread. The teacher scolded him for not concentrating on his work. If only, he thought, it was time to go home. Then he felt the silver ball in his pocket. If he pulled out a tiny bit of thread, the day would be over. Very carefully he took hold of it and tugged. Suddenly the teacher was telling everyone to pack up their books and to leave the classroom in an orderly fashion. Peter was overjoyed. He ran all the way home. How easy life would be now! All his troubles were over. From that day forth he began to pull the thread, just a little, every day.</p>  <p>One day, however, it occurred to him that it was stupid to pull the thread just a little each day. If he gave it a harder tug, school would be over altogether. Then he could start learning a trade and marry Liese. So that night he gave the thread a hard tug, and in the morning he awoke to find himself apprenticed to a carpenter in town. He loved his new life, clambering about on roofs and scaffolding, lifting and hammering great beams into place that still smelled of the forest. But sometimes, when payday seemed too far off, he gave the thread a little tug and suddenly the week was drawing to a close and it was Friday night and he had money in his pocket.</p>  <p>Liese had also come to town and was living with her aunt, who taught her housekeeping. Peter began to grow impatient for the day when they would be married. It was hard to live so near and yet so far from her. He asked her when they could be married.</p>  <p>"In another year," she said. "Then I will have learned how to be a capable wife."</p>  <p>Peter fingered the silver ball in his pocket.</p>  <p>"Well, the time will pass quickly enough," he said, knowingly.</p>  <p>That night Peter could not sleep. He tossed and turned restlessly. He took the magic ball from under his pillow. For a moment he hesitated; then his impatience got the better of him, and he tugged at the golden thread. In the morning he awoke to find that the year was over and that Liese had at last agreed to marry him. Now Peter felt truly happy.</p>  <p>But before their wedding could take place, Peter received an official-looking letter. He opened it in trepidation and read that he was expected to report at the army barracks the following week for two years’ military service. He showed the letter to Liese in despair.</p>  <p>"Well," she said, "there is nothing for it, we shall just have to wait. But the time will pass quickly, you’ll see. There are so many things to do in preparation for our life together."</p>  <p>Peter smiled bravely, knowing that two years would seem a lifetime to him.</p>  <p>Once Peter had settled into life at the barracks, however, he began to feel that it wasn’t so bad after all. He quite enjoyed being with all the other young men, and their duties were not very arduous at first. He remembered the old woman’s warning to use the thread wisely and for a while refrained from pulling it. But in time he grew restless again. Army life bored him with its routine duties and harsh discipline. He began pulling the thread to make the week go faster so that it would be Sunday again, or to speed up the time until he was due for leave. And so the two years passed almost as if they had been a dream.</p>  <p>Back home, Peter determined not to pull the thread again until it was absolutely necessary. After all, this was the best time of his life, as everyone told him. He did not want it to be over too quickly. He did, however, give the thread one or two very small tugs, just to speed along the day of his marriage. He longed to tell Liese his secret, but he knew that if he did he would die.</p>  <p>On the day of his wedding, everyone, including Peter, was happy. He could hardly wait to show Liese the house he had built for her. At the wedding feast he glanced over at his mother. He noticed for the first time how gray her hair had grown recently. She seemed to be aging so quickly. Peter felt a pang of guilt that he had pulled the thread so often. Henceforward he would be much more sparing with it and only use it when it was strictly necessary.</p>  <p>A few months later Liese announced that she was going to have a child. Peter was overjoyed and could hardly wait. When the child was born, he felt that he could never want for anything again. But whenever the child was ill or cried through the sleepless night, he gave the thread a little tug, just so that the baby might be well and happy again.</p>  <p>Times were hard. Business was bad and a government had come to power that squeezed the people dry with taxes and would tolerate no opposition. Anyone who became known as a troublemaker was thrown into prison without trial and rumor was enough to condemn a man. Peter had always been known as one who spoke his mind, and very soon he was arrested and cast into jail. Luckily he had his magic ball with him and he tugged very hard at the thread. The prison walls dissolved before him and his enemies were scattered in the huge explosion that burst forth like thunder. It was the war that had been threatening, but it was over as quickly as a summer storm, leaving behind it an exhausted peace. Peter found himself back home with his family. But now he was a middle-aged man.</p>  <p>For a time things went well and Peter lived in relative contentment. One day he looked at his magic ball and saw to his surprise that the thread had turned from gold to silver. He looked in the mirror. His hair was starting to turn gray and his face was lined where before there had not been a wrinkle to be seen. He suddenly felt afraid and determined to use the thread even more carefully than before. Liese bore him more children and he seemed happy as the head of his growing household. His stately manner often made people think of him as some sort of benevolent ruler. He had an air of authority as if he held the fate of others in his hands. He kept his magic ball in a well-hidden place, safe from the curious eyes of his children, knowing that if anyone were to discover it, it would be fatal.</p>  <p>As the number of his children grew, so his house became more overcrowded. He would have to extend it, but for that he needed money. He had other worries too. His mother was looking older and more tired every day. It was of no use to pull the magic thread because that would only hasten her approaching death. All too soon she died, and as Peter stood at her graveside, he wondered how it was that life passed so quickly, even without pulling the magic thread.</p>  <p>One night as he lay in bed, kept awake by his worries, he thought how much easier life would be if all his children were grown up and launched upon their careers in life. He gave the thread a mighty tug, and the following day he awoke to find that his children had all left home for jobs in different parts of the country, and that he and his wife were alone. His hair was almost white now and often his back and limbs ached as he climbed the ladder or lifted a heavy beam into place. Liese too was getting old and she was often ill. He couldn’t bear to see her suffer, so that more and more he resorted to pulling at the magic thread. But as soon as one trouble was solved, another seemed to grow in its place. Perhaps life would be easier if he retired, Peter thought. Then he would no longer have to clamber about on drafty, half-completed buildings and he could look after Liese when she was ill. The trouble was that he didn’t have enough money to live on. He picked up his magic ball and looked at it. To his dismay he saw that the thread was no longer silver but gray and lusterless. He decided to go for a walk in the forest to think things over.</p>  <p>It was a long time since he had been in that part of the forest. The small saplings had all grown into tall fir trees, and it was hard to find the path he had once known. Eventually he came to a bench in a clearing. He sat down to rest and fell into a light doze. He was woken by someone calling his name, "Peter! Peter!"</p>  <p>He looked up and saw the old woman he had met so many years ago when she had given him the magic silver ball with its golden thread. She looked just as she had on that day, not a day older. She smiled at him.</p>  <p>"So, Peter, have you had a good life?" she asked.</p>  <p>"I’m not sure," Peter said. "Your magic ball is a wonderful thing. I have never had to suffer or wait for anything in my life. And yet it has all passed so quickly. I feel that I have had no time to take in what has happened to me, neither the good things nor the bad. Now there is so little time left. I dare not pull the thread again for it will only bring me to my death. I do not think your gift has brought me luck."</p>  <p>"How ungrateful you are!" the old woman said. "In what way would you have wished things to be different?"</p>  <p>"Perhaps if you had given me a different ball, one where I could have pushed the thread back in as well as pulling it out. Then I could have relived the things that went badly."</p>  <p>The old woman laughed. "You ask a great deal! Do you think that God allows us to live our lives twice over? But I can grant you one final wish, you foolish, demanding man."</p>  <p>"What is that?" Peter asked.</p>  <p>"Choose," the old woman said. Peter thought hard.</p>  <p>At length he said, "I should like to live my life again as if for the first time, but without your magic ball. Then I will experience the bad things as well as the good without cutting them short, and at least my life will not pass as swiftly and meaninglessly as a daydream."</p>  <p>"So be it," said the old woman. "Give me back my ball."</p>  <p>She stretched out her hand and Peter placed the silver ball in it. Then he sat back and closed his eyes with exhaustion.</p>  <p>When he awoke he was in his own bed. His youthful mother was bending over him, shaking him gently.</p>  <p>"Wake up, Peter. You will be late for school. You were sleeping like the dead!"</p>  <p>He looked up at her in surprise and relief.</p>  <p>"I’ve had a terrible dream, Mother. I dreamed that I was old and sick and that my life had passed like the blinking of an eye with nothing to show for it. Not even any memories."</p>  <p>His mother laughed and shook her head.</p>  <p>"That will never happen," she said. "Memories are the one thing we all have, even when we are old. Now hurry and get dressed. Liese is waiting for you and you will be late for school."</p>  <p>As Peter walked to school with Liese, he noticed what a bright summer morning it was, the kind of morning when it felt good to be alive. Soon he would see his friends and classmates, and even the prospect of lessons didn’t seem so bad. In fact he could hardly wait.</p>    <hr class="hr-placeholder">      <p>Written by Anonymous</p>    <p>Excerpted from <i class="work-title">The Book of Virtues</i>.</p>	NULL	<p>Too often, people want what they want (or what they think they want, which is usually "happiness" in one form or another) right now.

Then I could have relived the things that went badly."</p>  <p>The old woman laughed. "You ask a great deal! Do you think that God allows us to live our lives twice over? But I can grant you one final wish, you foolish, demanding man."</p>  <p>"What is that?" Peter asked.</p>  <p>"Choose," the old woman said. Peter thought hard.</p>  <p>At length he said, "I should like to live my life again as if for the first time, but without your magic ball. Then I will experience the bad things as well as the good without cutting them short, and at least my life will not pass as swiftly and meaninglessly as a daydream."</p>  <p>"So be it," said the old woman. "Give me back my ball."</p>  <p>She stretched out her hand and Peter placed the silver ball in it. Then he sat back and closed his eyes with exhaustion.</p>  <p>When he awoke he was in his own bed. His youthful mother was bending over him, shaking him gently.</p>  <p>"Wake up, Peter. You will be late for school. You were sleeping like the dead!"</p>  <p>He looked up at her in surprise and relief.</p>  <p>"I’ve had a terrible dream, Mother. I dreamed that I was old and sick and that my life had passed like the blinking of an eye with nothing to show for it. Not even any memories."</p>  <p>His mother laughed and shook her head.</p>  <p>"That will never happen," she said. "Memories are the one thing we all have, even when we are old. Now hurry and get dressed. Liese is waiting for you and you will be late for school."</p>  <p>As Peter walked to school with Liese, he noticed what a bright summer morning it was, the kind of morning when it felt good to be alive. Soon he would see his friends and classmates, and even the prospect of lessons didn’t seem so bad. In fact he could hardly wait.</p>   <div class="hr-container">      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 360 40" class="hr-image">          <circle cx="20"  cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="100" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="180" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="260" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="340" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />      </svg>      <hr class="visuallyhidden">  </div>   <p>Written by Anonymous</p>    <p>Excerpted from <i class="work-title">The Book of Virtues</i>.</p>	The Magic Thread cautions about impatience and discontent.	2016-12-17 00:00:00.0000000 +00:00	1	NULL	Too of­ten, peo­ple want what they want (or what they think they want, which is usu­ally "hap­pi­ness" in one form or an­other) right now.

It has been another good, full year for our little family.</p>    <p>We have really enjoyed watching Lydia grow into the walking, talking (a little!), happy 15-month-old apple of our eyes. We are blessed that she is very observant, quick to learn new skills, and rarely sick. Her newest skill is being able to point to different body parts when named. 👶</p>    <figure>            <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-12-25-christmas-letter-lydia.jpg" alt="Lydia making a funny face">    </figure>      <p>Melissa is still enjoying the best job ever—being a stay-at-home mom!

And one of my favorite parts of the beginning is choosing the tools. The possibilities are limitless, and you can easily spend days (or weeks!) browsing Github repositories, reading blogs, trawling through Stack Overflow questions, etc.</p>    <p>I recently started a personal project, and, after the prerequisite soul-searching, decided to use Ruby on Rails. Now, professionally, I’m a Windows stack guy. Intellisense. C#. Oh yeah. But for this project, I wanted to try something different. Leave the minivan in the garage, and take the convertible out for a spin, so to speak. So I went with the polar opposite of .NET WebForms: Ruby on Rails.</p>    <p>It also helped that Rails is FOSS. (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> isn’t free, but it’s worth it.) I’m not a drum-beating, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Stallmanesque</a>, “Rah rah Open Source!” person, but neither am I a spendthrift. Since its just a personal project, I wanted to go with a low cost solution.</p>    <p>Also, Ruby on Rails seemed to be a good fit for this project. It’s basically going to be a CRUD app for now; maybe it will be more later, maybe not. But I don’t think I’ll be needing cool kid <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and his new-fangled ways. If I do end up adding more dynamic functionality (and what website doesn’t these days?) I’m planning to use <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>.</p>    <p>And, I’ll admit it, I chose Rails because Rails is cool. Maybe it’s not so cool here in 2013 as it was a few years ago; in fact I went through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a> myself while I was researching options:</p>    <ol>      <li>Hey look, Ruby on Rails. Ruby is cool.</li>      <li>No, it’s <em>really</em> cool. Rails is the One True Path!</li>      <li>Wait, a guy on a blog says it’s not cool.</li>      <li>Another guy would rather write PHP than Rails (this is the lowest point of the disillusionment trough). I don’t like Rails.</li>      <li>Wait, Rails isn’t that bad. These people are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. (And really, who throws out their bathwater these days? Let it run down the drain, sure, but actually throw it out?)</li>      <li>OK, Rails is pretty good. Not perfect, but good.</li>  </ol>    <p>Anyway, a week or so after I settled for sure on Ruby/Rails/Ember, <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> launched. And what do you know, Jeff Atwood et al. chose the same tech I had. That’s good enough confirmation for me. Yes, Ruby on Rails is not a panacea; in our lucid moments, I think we all know that nothing is. But it’s a solid framework, it will work for me, I’m going to learn a lot, and—most importantly—it’s going to be fun.</p>	NULL	<p>I don’t know about you, but the beginning of a programming project is one of my favorite times.

32	Preventing Duplicate Selections with C# and jQuery Validation	preventing-duplicate-selections-with-c-and-jquery-validation	article/2013/09/05/1/preventing-duplicate-selections-with-c-and-jquery-validation	<p>A few days ago, while working on a web page, I got to write my favorite type of code: validation.</p>    <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2013-09-05-validation.png" alt="jQuery validation" />  </figure>    <p>Ha ha. Actually I’d rather floss with a brick than write validation.</p>    <p>Anyway, I was writing validation for an ASP.NET/C# registration page. The page has three dropdown lists, each with the same list of courses. Students can register for up to three courses by choosing a course in each dropdown list. The validation I was writing needed to prevent a student from registering for a course multiple times. It seemed like there should be a simple solution, but it wasn’t jumping out at me, so I started to pseudocode a naive solution.</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/8260138.js?file=PreventingDuplicates1.txt"> </script>    <p>Okay, not very elegant. And not easily scalable <del>if</del> when I’m asked to add a fourth dropdown.  I started coding it out a little more in the hopes of seeing a pattern.</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/8260138.js?file=PreventingDuplicates2.txt"> </script>    <p>Then I had a “eureka” moment: I could put the values in an array, get the count of unique items, and check if the number of values is equal to the number of unique values.</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/8260138.js?file=PreventingDuplicates1.cs"> </script>    <p>This works because I don’t care how many duplicates there are, or which values are duplicated.

The page has three dropdown lists, each with the same list of courses. Students can register for up to three courses by choosing a course in each dropdown list. The validation I was writing needed to prevent a student from registering for a course multiple times.

35	A Complex Query	a-complex-query	article/2014/07/17/1/a-complex-query	<p>I’ve written a lot of SQL, but most of it tends to be pretty simple. Even most of the large queries that I’ve written aren’t complex, they just have a lot of tables and columns to deal with. Probably the most complicated and interesting query I’ve written calculates dates based on a hierarchy of date offsets.</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ca097b7775b95f130a40.js?file=Query-Blog.sql"> </script>    <p>Recursion, a cross join, a full outer join…there’s a lot of interesting pieces here. Let’s break it down:</p>    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid,         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) + column_value - 2 /*Gets last, this, and next year*/AS eventyear    FROM eventdateoffsets   CROSS     JOIN table(integers(3))   WHERE parentoffsetid IS NULL  </code></pre>    <p><code>integers</code> is an alias for a simple function that returns a pipelined array of numbers from 1 up to the parameter provided:</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ca097b7775b95f130a40.js?file=integers.sql"> </script>    <p>So <code>integers(3)</code> returns an array containing 1, 2, 3. <code>table</code> is an alias for a function that converts the array to an Oracle table, which allows us to join to it. A cross join (aka Cartesian join) matches every row in table A with every row in table B, so no join conditions are necessary.</p>    <p><code>eventdateoffsets</code> is the table holding all the event information:</p>    <table>      <thead>          <tr>              <th>eventdateoffsets</th>              <th> </th>          </tr>      </thead>      <tbody>          <tr>              <td>offsetid</td>              <td>Number (PK)</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>eventname</td>              <td>Varchar2</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>parentoffsetid</td>              <td>Number</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>eventoffset</td>              <td>Interval</td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>    <p>The parentoffsetid is the offsetid of the date that this date is based on. The eventoffset is how much before or after the parent date that the event takes place. This allows us to set up relations from our business rules like “registration always takes place two days after Labor Day” or “students can cancel courses until one week after classes begin”. The data looks something like this:</p>    <table>      <thead>          <tr>              <th>offsetid</th>              <th>eventname</th>              <th>parentoffsetid</th>              <th>eventoffset</th>          </tr>      </thead>      <tbody>          <tr>              <td>1</td>              <td>Labor Day</td>              <td>null</td>              <td>null</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>2</td>              <td>Registration Begins</td>              <td>1</td>              <td>+ 00 08:00</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>3</td>              <td>Registration Ends</td>              <td>2</td>              <td>+ 03 14:00</td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>    <p>Here registration begins at 8 <abbr>am</abbr> on Labor Day and ends three days later at 10 <abbr>pm</abbr>. Notice that Labor Day doesn’t have a parent; that will be important later.</p>    <p>Back to the query:</p>    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid,         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) + column_value - 2 /*Gets last, this, and next year*/AS eventyear    FROM eventdateoffsets   CROSS     JOIN table(integers(3))   WHERE parentoffsetid IS NULL  </code></pre>    <p><code>EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) + column_value - 2</code> gets the current year (as of this writing, 2014) and adds the value from the integers table (1, 2, 3) and subtracts 2. In effect, this adds -1, 0, and 1 to the current year, giving us last year, this year, and next year (as of this writing 2013, 2014, and 2015).</p>    <p><code>WHERE parentoffsetid IS NULL</code>: remember in our example how Labor Day didn’t have a parent? This query is getting all the dates without a parent; I call them “source dates”. These are our foundation. Some are holidays like Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Others are dates determined by Business Rules which haven’t been integrated into this system. This part of the query gets all the source dates with an <code>eventyear</code> of last year, this year, and next year. Let’s go one level higher:</p>    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid, eventyear,        (SELECT api.GetSourceDate(eventname, eventyear) FROM dual) AS eventdate,        (SELECT api.GetSourceAcademicYear(eventname, eventyear) FROM dual) AS academicyear  FROM (SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid,               EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) + column_value - 2 /*Gets last, this, and next year*/AS eventyear          FROM eventdateoffsets         CROSS           JOIN table(integers(3))         WHERE parentoffsetid IS NULL       )  </code></pre>    <p><code>api.GetSourceDate()</code> calculates the date for a source date for a given year.

Since child dates can be parents for further dates, we need to calculate the hierarchy recursively:</p>      <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid, eventyear,        (SELECT api.GetSourceDate(eventname, eventyear) FROM dual) AS eventdate  FROM (SELECT eventname, displayname, offsetid, parentoffsetid,               EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) + column_value - 2 /*Gets last, this, and next year*/AS eventyear          FROM eventdateoffsets         CROSS           JOIN table(integers(3))         WHERE parentoffsetid IS NULL       )  UNION ALL  SELECT childdates.eventname, childdates.displayname, childdates.offsetid,        childdates.parentoffsetid, eventyear,        (SELECT api.GetEventDate(eventdatesrecursive.eventdate, childdates.offsetid, childdates.eventoffset, eventyear) FROM dual) AS eventdate  FROM eventdateoffsets childdates  JOIN eventdatesrecursive    ON childdates.parentoffsetid = eventdatesrecursive.offsetid  </code></pre>    <p>This the the <abbr>ANSI</abbr>-standard way of doing recursion. You have a query to calculate your starting data, which is then <code>UNION</code>ed to your dependent data.</p>    <p>The <code>GetEventDate</code> function basically adds the child date’s offset interval to the parent date’s date to get the child date’s date. It also takes Leap Year into account for dates that are set up to be run on a certain day every year (e.g. Independence Day is always July 4).</p>    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ca097b7775b95f130a40.js?file=GetEventDate.sql"> </script>    <p>With the recursion tucked out of the way in a <code>WITH</code>, the rest of the query is easy.</p>    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT nvl(overrides.eventname, offsets.eventname) AS eventname, offsets.displayname,          nvl(overrides.eventdate, offsets.eventdate) AS eventdate    FROM eventdatesrecursive offsets    FULL OUTER    JOIN eventdateoverrides overrides      ON offsets.eventname = overrides.eventname     AND offsets.academicyear = overrides.academicyear;  </code></pre>    <p>There is an overrides table which allows any calculated date to be overwritten by entering a row into the table.

The difficulty comes in understanding the query as a whole.</p>	NULL	<p>I’ve written a lot of SQL, but most of it tends to be pretty simple. Even most of the large queries that I’ve written aren’t complex, they just have a lot of tables and columns to deal with.

A cross join (aka Cartesian join) matches every row in table A with every row in table B, so no join conditions are necessary.</p>    <p><code>eventdateoffsets</code> is the table holding all the event information:</p>    <table>      <thead>          <tr>              <th>eventdateoffsets</th>              <th> </th>          </tr>      </thead>      <tbody>          <tr>              <td>offsetid</td>              <td>Number (PK)</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>eventname</td>              <td>Varchar2</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>parentoffsetid</td>              <td>Number</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>eventoffset</td>              <td>Interval</td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>    <p>The parentoffsetid is the offsetid of the date that this date is based on.

It’s been a great year in the Koser house, full of activities that have brought us closer together as a family.</p>  <p>Three birthday parties were among the highlights of the year. In February, we hosted a murder mystery escape room for Melissa’s brother Tim’s birthday. Melissa set up the escape room and enjoyed watching everyone try to solve her riddles and clues.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-escape-room.jpg" alt="Murder Mystery Escape Room characters">      <figcaption>The Murder Mystery suspects</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Brian’s birthday in April featured a root beer tasting party!

Brian and Melissa went for the food (fresh shrimp, crab cakes, Brian’s first taste of shark, and fried Oreos), while Lydia really enjoyed getting her face painted for the first time!</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-rainbow-kitty.jpg" alt="Lydia with her Rainbow Kitty face paint">      <figcaption>Rainbow Kitty!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Some other unique experiences from 2018 were petting a kangaroo at the Gulf Coast Zoo, attending a deluxe movie theater (complete with recliners and waiters who bring you fancy food!), and visiting New Orleans with Brian’s sister Megan and her husband Josh to check out the Audubon Aquarium.</p>  <p>By far some of our best memories came from our summer travels. In late May, we went on our Midwest Road Trip: 14 states, 12 stops, and lots of friends and family crammed into two weeks. The girls handled all of that driving like champs. You can hear all about the trip <a href="http://tto.koser.us/episodes/079-midwest-road-trip-2018/">on our podcast</a>.</p>  <p>One week after we returned home, Melissa was able to fly out to Colorado with baby Amber and surprise her sister Melody.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-union-station.jpg" alt="Union Station, Kansas City, Missouri">      <figcaption>Union Station in Kansas City</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>September saw us check an item off our bucket list: we attended a standup special featuring Brian Regan, our favorite comedian! That night may have been the hardest we laughed all year.</p>  <p>The last big event we attended was our first NFL game in November. We met up with Brian’s family in New Orleans and watched the Eagles play the Saints. Since half of the family are Eagles fans and half are Saints fans, only half left the game happy. :)</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-eagles-game.jpg" alt="Kosers and Tim at the Eagles-Saints game">      <figcaption>Fly Eagles Fly!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Brian also made it to his first NBA game with Tim to see Tim’s Miami Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans. Tim also finished the year with us, spending the Christmas week playing board games and introducing Brian to some Binzel-favorite Christmas movies.</p>  <p>Amber started walking and knows what cows, pigs, and sheep say.</p>  <p>Lydia was finally potty trained this past February! It has been so nice to only have one diaper to change in this house. She also started doing some preschool classes at a homeschool co-op hosted at our church. At the end of the year she sang her first church special with Melissa.</p>  <figure>      <div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/309018670" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>      <figcaption>Melissa and Lydia singing “God’s Been Good”</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Melissa accomplished several home projects, including a busyboard for Amber, an apron for Lydia, a dice tray for Brian, and a framed board game for them all.</p>  <p>Brian started being more health-conscious and lost 20 pounds. At work he got a promotion and started a ping pong league. And his major project was <a href="http://sfc.blue">sfc.blue</a>, a listener’s guide for our favorite podcast, The Sci-Fi Christian.</p>  <p>It was a great year, and we’re very excited about all that 2019 has in store for us.

Brian and Melissa went for the food (fresh shrimp, crab cakes, Brian’s first taste of shark, and fried Oreos), while Lydia really enjoyed getting her face painted for the first time!</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-rainbow-kitty.jpg" alt="Lydia with her Rainbow Kitty face paint">      <figcaption>Rainbow Kitty!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Some other unique experiences from 2018 were petting a kangaroo at the Gulf Coast Zoo, attending a deluxe movie theater (complete with recliners and waiters who bring you fancy food!), and visiting New Orleans with Brian’s sister Megan and her husband Josh to check out the Audubon Aquarium.</p>  <p>By far some of our best memories came from our summer travels. In late May, we went on our Midwest Road Trip: 14 states, 12 stops, and lots of friends and family crammed into two weeks. The girls handled all of that driving like champs. You can hear all about the trip <a href="http://tto.koser.us/episodes/079-midwest-road-trip-2018/">on our podcast</a>.</p>  <p>One week after we returned home, Melissa was able to fly out to Colorado with baby Amber and surprise her sister Melody.</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-union-station.jpg" alt="Union Station, Kansas City, Missouri">      <figcaption>Union Station in Kansas City</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>September saw us check an item off our bucket list: we attended a standup special featuring Brian Regan, our favorite comedian! That night may have been the hardest we laughed all year.</p>  <p>The last big event we attended was our first NFL game in November. We met up with Brian’s family in New Orleans and watched the Eagles play the Saints. Since half of the family are Eagles fans and half are Saints fans, only half left the game happy. :)</p>  <figure>      <img src="http://cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-eagles-game.jpg" alt="Kosers and Tim at the Eagles-Saints game">      <figcaption>Fly Eagles Fly!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Brian also made it to his first NBA game with Tim to see Tim’s Miami Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans. Tim also finished the year with us, spending the Christmas week playing board games and introducing Brian to some Binzel-favorite Christmas movies.</p>  <p>Amber started walking and knows what cows, pigs, and sheep say.</p>  <p>Lydia was finally potty trained this past February! It has been so nice to only have one diaper to change in this house. She also started doing some preschool classes at a homeschool co-op hosted at our church. At the end of the year she sang her first church special with Melissa.</p>  <figure>      <div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/309018670" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>      <figcaption>Melissa and Lydia singing “God’s Been Good”</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Melissa accomplished several home projects, including a busyboard for Amber, an apron for Lydia, a dice tray for Brian, and a framed board game for them all.</p>  <p>Brian started being more health-conscious and lost 20 pounds. At work he got a promotion and started a ping pong league. And his major project was <a href="http://sfc.blue">sfc.blue</a>, a listener’s guide for our favorite podcast, The Sci-Fi Christian.</p>  <p>It was a great year, and we’re very excited about all that 2019 has in store for us.

Why? Because there's something so delightful about the unknown, so thrilling about being in a new environment with new sights, sounds, smells, and sensations. Even places we've previously been to can be exciting, if they're not well-known or haven't been visited in some time: a house you've just moved into (but haven't yet unpacked), a store whose merchandise changes with the seasons, a different street explored on your daily walk.

Even places we've previously been to can be exciting, if they're not well-known or haven't been visited in some time: a house you've just moved into (but haven't yet unpacked), a store whose merchandise changes with the seasons, a different street explored on your daily walk. Bored with your life? You needn't leave town to experience change.

The three selected franchises will hire part-time atheist employees to work one day a week, allowing the famously Christian organization to remain open on Sundays.</p><p>"This initiative will allow us to serve all members of our community every day of the week, and still retain our convictions to honor the Lord's Day," said Cathy Belmont, Chik-fil-A public relations spokesman. "These workers of no faith will allow us to honor our faith."</p><p>Local evangelical pastors have been quick to criticize the move. "I just completed a seven-week sermon series on 'Keeping the Sabbath'", said Reverend Lincoln Hereford. "We had finally committed as a church to only eat canned foods on Sunday, but all of that progress has been erased by Chik-fil-A. How am I supposed to keep the flock away from crispy chicken sandwiches after the morning service?" Reverend Hereford declined to comment when asked if he would be protesting the change with a boycott.</p><p>Chik-fil-A sees no conflict.

"Would it be better for them to purchase the burgers of this world, or to worship God together over a plate of waffle fries?"</p><p>Local Chik-fil-A management is also in favor of the move. "I will of course be on call every Sunday," said Angus Kerry, manager at the Airport Boulevard franchise. "It will be a spiritual hardship, but Chik-fil-A has worked with my schedule and remuneration to ensure that I can shoulder the burden."</p><p>The manager does not foresee any conflict between the current and incoming employees. "With cross-training and schedule substitutions, it's inevitable that there will be some mixing of the employees," said Mr. Kerry. "But all our full-time employees will go through sensitivity training to learn how to interact with the new employees. And we will strongly discourage proselytizing on the job to reduce turnover in the non-faith-practicing portion of our staff."</p><p>Chik-fil-A has also faced renewed criticism from synagogues and Seventh-Day Adventist churches.

I modified their 2019 handbook by removing rules for doubles and handicapped-player matches, and by rewording rules for clarity.    Definitions  A rally is the period during which the ball is in play.  The ball is in play from the beginning of the serve until the rally is decided as a let or a point.  A let is a rally where the result is not scored.  A point is a rally where the result is scored.  The racket hand is the hand carrying the racket.  The free hand is the hand not carrying the racket; the free arm is the arm of the free hand.  A player strikes the ball if they touch it in play with their racket (held in the hand), or with their racket hand down to the wrist.  A player obstructs the ball if they, or anything they wear or carry, touch it in play when it is above or travelling towards the playing surface, not having touched their court since last being struck by their opponent.  The server is the player due to strike the ball first in a rally.  The receiver is the player due to strike the ball second in a rally.  The end lines are the lines on each end of the table. They extend indefinitely in both directions.  The Service  Service shall start with the ball resting on the open palm of the server’s stationary free hand.  The server shall toss the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin, so that it rises at least 6 inches and then falls without touching anything before being struck.  As the ball is falling the server shall strike it so that it touches first their court and then directly touches the receiver's court.  From the start of service until it is struck, the ball shall be above the table and behind the server's end line, and it shall not be hidden from the receiver by the server.  The Return  The ball, having been served or returned, shall be struck so that it touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.  The Order of Play  The server shall first make a service, the receiver shall then make a return and thereafter server and receiver alternately shall each make a return.  A Let  The rally shall be a let:  if in service the ball touches the net assembly, provided the service is otherwise correct;  if the service is delivered when the receiving player is not ready, provided that the receiver does not attempt to strike the ball;  if a disturbance outside the control of the player interrupts play.  A Point  Unless the rally is a let, a player shall score a point  if the opponent fails to make a correct service;  if the opponent fails to make a correct return;  if, after they have made a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by the opponent;  if the ball passes over their court or beyond their end line without touching their court, after being struck by the opponent;  if the ball, after being struck by the opponent, passes through the net or between the net and the net post or between the net and playing surface;  if the opponent obstructs the ball;  if the opponent deliberately strikes the ball twice in succession;  if the opponent, or anything the opponent wears or carries, moves the playing surface;  if the opponent, or anything the opponent wears or carries, touches the net assembly;  if the opponent's free hand touches the playing surface.  A Game  The first player to score 11 points wins the game, unless both players score 10 points, when the first player to next gain a lead of 2 points wins the game.  A Match  A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games.  The Order of Serving, Receiving, and Ends  The right to choose the initial order of serving, receiving and ends shall be decided randomly and the winner may choose to serve or to receive first or to start at a particular end.  When one player has chosen to serve or to receive first or to start at a particular end, the other player shall have the other choice.   After each 2 points have been scored the receiving player shall become the serving player and so on until the end of the game, unless both players score 10 points, when the sequences of serving and receiving shall be the same but each player shall serve for only 1 point in turn.  The player serving first in a game shall receive first in the next game of the match.  The player starting at one end in a game shall start at the other end in the next game of the match and in the last possible game of a match the players shall change ends when one player scores 5 points.  Out of Order of Serving, Receiving, or Ends  If a player serves or receives out of turn, interrupt play as soon as the error is discovered and continue with the correct player serving.  If the players have not changed ends when they should have, interrupt play to switch ends and continue.  All points scored before the discovery of an error still count.	<p>The International Tables Tennis Federation (ITFF) sets the official ruleset for ping pong, "The Laws of Table Tennis".
