Without "grit" you will let your children run wild, your family and friends repeat lies they read on Facebook, your clients give you bad software specifications that everyone will regret later (just me?); to avoid hurting feelings or making waves.

Without "grace" you will be a tyrant that your children rebel against, a jerk to your friends and family, and a "problem worker" or just fired. You might bully some people into agreement, but you won't persuade anyone to change their mind.

A teacher with truth but no love for the subject or the students will never get their students' attention, failing to teach. A teacher with love but no truth would be worse, walking their students down a path of sophistry.

I also see these as the biggest pitfalls of both sides of the political spectrum: conservatives lack "grace" and make the mistake of pragmatism, while liberals lack "grit" and make the mistake of naivet√©. (Obviously that's an extremely broad stereotype; I'm not saying conservatives don't love their families or liberals don't stand up for their political beliefs. If it helps, pretend I stereotyped gender and said men lack grace and women lack grit. Glad I could smooth that over.)
