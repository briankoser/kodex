believes that white supremacy has invaded every aspect of Western life; that white American leaders perpetuate white supremacy by encouraging violence against black people; that this society must be dismantled; that anti-racism is our greatest calling at this time; and that if you disagree, it's due to white fragility.

I think it's more complicated than that. 

America didn't separate from Britain over slavery

We have to simplify when we talk about anything, otherwise we end up in a version of the Steven Wright joke about the actual-size US map (scale: 1 mile = 1 mile). But the danger of idealogies is oversimplification. Oversimplifying is seductive because it's easy. You can fit your beliefs into a tweet or even a hashtag. Your side is true and righteous. Anyone that disagrees is the enemy and evil.

Some beliefs really are simple. Simple doesn't mean wrong. But most things are complicated.

Serendipitously, the New York Times published an article today that illustrates this point: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/opinion/redlining-systemic-racism.html 

Taking the risk and simplifying: McWhorter presents data supporting poverty as a factor in redlining and racial inequity for police killings. He doesn't say there's no systemic racism or racist police officers; he says the truth is more complicated.

Osheta writes: "White supremacy has a high value on the written word: if someone has researched it, written about it, and can refute it, then White people tend to believe it over the lived and shared experience of others."

She's right that research and writing doesn't make something true (shifting nutrition guidelines is any easy example). And a literate culture isn't morally superior to a non-literate culture. 

But neither is a non-literate culture morally superior. The written word is important to me, and discarding that part of Western culture would be a tragic loss of truth, good, and beauty. Maybe we need a deeper discussion about what "dismantling" means for things like this.

Osheta believes that Western society is too individualistic. I agree! We should talk about how to fix that.

Western culture is not totally good or totally bad; it's complicated. We should keep the good and discard the bad. And those are the strengths of both sides: conservatives want to keep, liberals want to progress. Deciding what is good and what is bad is difficult. We'll never agree completely. Talking past each other with hashtags won't help. Real discussion will help: speaking with grit and grace, and listening. We'll realize that we agree on a lot and that disagreement is possible between rational people.
