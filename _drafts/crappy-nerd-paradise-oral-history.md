Blake O'Hare aka Mr. Xenon started Nerd Paradise in the 1990s. Some people used the site. Blake redesigned the site a few times. Some people stopped using the site. There was a Nerd Test and articles about solving Rubik's cubes.

I started using the site around 2004 with the username "Master Zota" and a Spongebob avatar. I was in high school and it was my first online community.

There were lots of people that hung out on the site. I remember eofpi, Ushanka, Spears Dracona, biblegeek, ikanreed, Myrddin. There were lots of other people I don't remember. Sorry. Should have picked more memorable usernames, I guess.

We wrote a lot on those forums, about a lot of different topics. I bet there was a lot of drama. There was definitely a lot of fun.

There were contests. I won a fan fiction contest with a Tetris fan fiction. I won a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy contest with a desktop wallpaper featuring a collage of images from the movie forming a "42". For one of those contests I won a t-shirt. It has the text "www.nerdparadise.com" and a rhombicuboctahedron. My middle daughter wears it as a pajama shirt.

There was an IRC channel. That was pretty cool.

Once, Blake made a video of fruit dancing to Mario music. One time he showed us that he could sneeze with his eyes open.

I think I dropped off the site when I started college in 2007. I got a computer science degree and am now a Senior Software Consultant. Married with three kids. I still love quirky websites and quirky communities. 

I can't identify anything specific from NP that changed my life. I never met anyone in real life or even kept up with them after I left. But to me, Nerd Paradise will always be the World Wide Web as it should be. Before social media took over and the gardens were walled, there was a community of people sharing an online life.

Thanks Blake.
