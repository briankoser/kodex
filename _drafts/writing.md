# Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury
- Write 1000-2000 words every day. Quantity precedes quality.
- Write with zest.
- Write about what you love or hate. Find a character and follow as fast as you can.
- Editing will be work, so enjoy the first draft.
- Make a list of evocative nouns for story prompts.
- Feed your muse with everything. Poetry that makes your arm hair stand up. Essays about everything from every time. Writing about the senses.
- Read authors who think like you and write the way you want to; read authors that don't.
- You learn from bad as well as good. Good quality can be mysterious; it's easy to pinpoint what not to do from bad.
- "The artist learns what to leave out."
- Don't plot ahead. Let your characters do.

# The Elements of Style
- 13. Make the paragraph the unit of composition (one topic)
- 14. Use active voice, but use passive for emphasis ("Pumpkins are not eaten in spring" vs "People don't eat pumpkins in spring")
- 17. Use definite, specific, concrete language
- 18. Avoid a succession of loose sentences (two clauses with a conjunction or relative like who or which)
- 20. Keep related words together
- 21. In summaries, keep to one tense
    - Summarize stories in present or past tense
    - Don't just summarize when reviewing literature. Write "an orderly discussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment".
    - Don't repeat "the author thinks", etc. State you are summarizing once.
- 22. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end
    - Or at the beginning, but a subject at the beginning is not automatically emphasized
    - Same for sentences in a paragraph and paragraphs in a composition

Writing with short words is harder but better than writing with big words.
