## Morning Prayer
Glory be to Thee. O Lord, glory to Thee. Glory to Thee who hast given me sleep to recruit my weakness, and to remit the toils of this fretful flesh.

To this day and all days, a perfect, holy, peaceful, healthy, sinless course, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

The angel of peace, a faithful guide, guardian of souls and bodics, to encamp round about me, and ever to prompt what is salutary, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Pardon and remission of all sins and of all offences, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

To our souls what is good and convenient, and peace to the world, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Repentance and strictness for the residue of our life, and health and peace to the end, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, that I may think on these things and do them, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

A Christian close, without sin, without shame, and, should it please Thee, without pain, and a good answer at the dreadful and fearful judgment scat of Jesus Christ our Lord, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

### Confession
Essence beyond essence, Nature uncreate, Framer of the universe, I set Thee, Lord, before my face, and I lift up my soul unto Thee. I worship Thee on my knees, and humble myself under Thy mighty hand. I stretch forth my hands unto Thee, my soul gaspeth unto Thee as a thirsty land. I smite on my breast, and say with the publican, God be merciful to me, a sinner, the chief of sinners; to the sinner above the publican, be merciful as to the publican. Father of mercies, I beseech Thy fatherly affection, despise me not, an unclean worm, a dead dog, a putrid corpse; despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands; despise not Thine own image though branded by sin. Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean; Lord, only say the word, and I shall be cleansed. 

And Thou, my Saviour Christ, Christ my Saviour, Saviour of sinners, of whom I am chief, despise me not; despise me not, O Lord, despise not the cost of Thy Blood, who am called by Thy name; but look upon me with those eyes with which Thou didst look upon Magdalene at the feast, Peter in the hall. the thief on the wood; that with the thief I may call on Thee humbly. Remember me, Lord, in Thy kingdom; that with Peter I may bitterly weep and say, O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night; that with Magdalene I may hear Thee say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; and with her may love much, for many sins, yea manifold, have been forgiven me. 

And Thou, all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, despise me not, Thy breath, despise not Thine own holy things; but turn thee again, O Lord, at the last, and be gracious unto Thy servant.
