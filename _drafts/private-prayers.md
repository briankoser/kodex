## Morning Prayer
Glory be to Thee. O Lord, glory to Thee. Glory to Thee who hast given me sleep to recruit my weakness, and to remit the toils of this fretful flesh.

To this day and all days, a perfect, holy, peaceful, healthy, sinless course, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

The angel of peace, a faithful guide, guardian of souls and bodics, to encamp round about me, and ever to prompt what is salutary, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Pardon and remission of all sins and of all offences, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

To our souls what is good and convenient, and peace to the world, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Repentance and strictness for the residue of our life, and health and peace to the end, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, that I may think on these things and do them, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

A Christian close, without sin, without shame, and, should it please Thee, without pain, and a good answer at the dreadful and fearful judgment scat of Jesus Christ our Lord, vouchsafe, O Lord.
