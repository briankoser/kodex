## Morning Prayer
Glory be to Thee. O Lord, glory to Thee. Glory to Thee who hast given me sleep to recruit my weakness, and to remit the toils of this fretful flesh.

To this day and all days, a perfect, holy, peaceful, healthy, sinless course, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

The angel of peace, a faithful guide, guardian of souls and bodics, to encamp round about me, and ever to prompt what is salutary, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Pardon and remission of all sins and of all offences, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

To our souls what is good and convenient, and peace to the world, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Repentance and strictness for the residue of our life, and health and peace to the end, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, that I may think on these things and do them, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

A Christian close, without sin, without shame, and, should it please Thee, without pain, and a good answer at the dreadful and fearful judgment scat of Jesus Christ our Lord, vouchsafe, O Lord. 

### Confession
Essence beyond essence, Nature uncreate, Framer of the universe, I set Thee, Lord, before my face, and I lift up my soul unto Thee. I worship Thee on my knees, and humble myself under Thy mighty hand. I stretch forth my hands unto Thee, my soul gaspeth unto Thee as a thirsty land. I smite on my breast, and say with the publican, God be merciful to me, a sinner, the chief of sinners; to the sinner above the publican, be merciful as to the publican. Father of mercies, I beseech Thy fatherly affection, despise me not, an unclean worm, a dead dog, a putrid corpse; despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands; despise not Thine own image though branded by sin. Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean; Lord, only say the word, and I shall be cleansed. 

And Thou, my Saviour Christ, Christ my Saviour, Saviour of sinners, of whom I am chief, despise me not; despise me not, O Lord, despise not the cost of Thy Blood, who am called by Thy name; but look upon me with those eyes with which Thou didst look upon Magdalene at the feast, Peter in the hall. the thief on the wood; that with the thief I may call on Thee humbly. Remember me, Lord, in Thy kingdom; that with Peter I may bitterly weep and say, O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night; that with Magdalene I may hear Thee say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; and with her may love much, for many sins, yea manifold, have been forgiven me. 

And Thou, all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, despise me not, Thy breath, despise not Thine own holy things; but turn thee again, O Lord, at the last, and be gracious unto Thy servant.


### Confession
Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, who turnest the shadow of death into the morning, and renewest the face of the earth; who separatest darkness from the face of the light (Gen. 1.4), and banishest night and bringest back the day; who lightenest mine eyes that I sleep not in death; who deliverest me from the terror by night, from the pestilence that walketh in darkness; who drivest sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids; who makest the out-goings of the morning and evening to praise Thee; because I laid me down and slept and rose up again, for the Lord sustained me; because I waked and beheld, and my sleep was sweet unto me. 

Blot out as a thick cloud my transgressions, and as a cloud my sins; grant me to be a child of light, a child of the day, to walk soberly, holily, honestly, as in the day. Vouchsafe to keep me this day without sin. Thou who upholdest the falling and liftest the fallen, let me not harden my heart in provocation, or temptation, or in deceitfulness of any sin. Moreover, deliver me to-day from the snare of the hunter, and from the noisome pestilence; from the arrow that flieth by day, from the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday. Defend this day against my evil, against the evil of this day defend Thou me. Let not my days be spent in vanity nor my years in sorrow. 

O let me hear Thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in Thee is my trust; show Thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto Thee. Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies, for I flee unto Thee. Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth Thee, for Thou art my God; let Thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness. Quicken me, O Lord, for Thy name's sake, and for Thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. Remove from me foolish imaginations, inspire those which are good and pleasing in Thy sight. Turn away mine eyes lest they behold vanity; let mine eyes look right on; and let mine eyelids look straight before me. Hedge up mine ears with thorns, lest they incline to undisciplined words. Give me early the ear to hear, and open mine eyes to the instructions of Thy oracles (Isa. 50.4). Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips. Let my word be seasoned with salt, that it may minister grace to the hearers. Let no deed be grief unto me nor offence of heart. Let me do some deed for which Thou wilt remember me, Lord, for good, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy. 

Into Thine hands I commend my spirit, soul and body, which Thou hast created, redeemed, regenerated, O Lord, Thou God of truth; and together with me all mine, and all that belongs to me. Thou hast vouchsafed them to me, O Lord, in Thy goodness. Guard us from all evil. Guard our souls, I beseech Thee, O Lord. Guard us without falling and place us faultless in the presence of Thy glory in that day. Guard my going out and my coming in henceforth and for ever. Prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of those who meet him.

O God, make speed to save me; O Lord, make haste to help me. O turn Thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and help the son of Thine handmaid. Show some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.

## Evening Prayer
The day is gone, and I give Thee thanks, O Lord. Evening is at hand, furnish it with brightness. As day has its evening so also has life; the even of life is age, age has overtaken me, furnish it with brightness. Cast me not away in the time of age; forsake me not when my strength faileth me. Even to my old age be Thou He, and even to hoar hairs carry me; do Thou make, do Thou bear, do Thou carry and deliver me (Isa. 46.4). Abide with me, Lord, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent of this fretful life. Let Thy strength be made perfect in my weakness. 

Day is fled and gone, life too is going, this lifeless life. Night cometh and cometh death, the deathless death. Near as is the end of day, so too is the end of life; we then also remembering it, beseech of Thee for the close of our life, that Thou wouldest direct it in peace, Christian, acceptable, sinless, shameless, and, if it please Thee, painless, Lord, our Lord, gathering us together under the feet of Thine elect, when Thou wilt and as Thou wilt, only without shame and sins. 

Remember we the days of darkness, for they shall be many, lest we be cast into outer darkness. Remember we to outstrip the night, doing some good thing. Near is judgment; a good and acceptable answer at the dreadful and fearful judgment seat of Jesus Christ, vouchsafe to us, O Lord. 

By night I lift up my hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord. The Lord hath granted His loving kindness in the day time; in the night season did I sing of Him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life. As long as I live will I magnify Thee on this manner, and lift up my hands in Thy name. Lord let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice. 

Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, who hast created the changes of days and nights, who givest songs in the night, who has delivered us from the evil of this day, who hast not cut off like a weaver my life, nor from day even to night made an end of me. 

### Confession
Lord, as we add day to day, so sin to sin. The just falleth seven times a day (Prov. 24.16); and I, an exceeding sinner, seventy times seven; a wonderful, a horrible thing, O Lord. But I turn with groans from my evil ways, and I return into my heart, and with all my heart I turn to Thee, O God of penitents and Saviour of sinners; and evening by evening will return in the innermost marrow of my soul; and my soul crieth out of the deep unto Thee. I have sinned, O Lord, against Thee, heavily against Thee; alas, alas, woe is me for my misery! I repent, O me, I repent; spare me, O Lord; repent, O me, I repent, help Thou me my impenitence. Be appeased, spare me, O Lord; be appeased, have mercy on me: I said, Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, after Thy great goodness, according to the multitude of Thy mercies do away mine offences. Remit the guilt, heal the wound, blot out the stains, clear away the shame, rescue from the tyranny, and make me not a public example. O bring me out of my trouble, cleanse Thou me from secret faults, keep Thy servant also from presumptuous sins. My wanderings of mind and idle talking lay not to my charge. Remove the dark and muddy flood of foul and wicked thoughts. O Lord, I have destroyed myself; whatever I have done amiss, pardon mercifully. Deal not with us after our sins, neither reward us after our iniquities. Look mercifully upon our infirmities; and for the glory of Thy all-holy name, turn from us all those ills and miseries, which by our sins, and by us through them, are most righteously and worthily deserved.

### Commendation
To my weariness, O Lord, vouchsafe Thou rest, to my exhaustion renew Thou strength. Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death. Deliver me from the terror by night, the pestilence that walketh in darkness (Ps. 91.6). Supply me with healthy sleep and to pass through this night without fear. 

O Keeper of Israel, who neither slumberest nor sleepest, guard me this night from all evil, guard my soul, O Lord. Visit me with the visitation of Thine own, reveal to me wisdom in the visions of the night. If not, for I am not worthy, not worthy, at least, O loving Lord, let sleep be to me a breathing time as from toil, so from sin. Yea, O Lord, nor let me in my dreams imagine what may anger Thee, what may defile me. Let not my loins be filled with illusions, yea, let my reins chasten me in the night season, yet without grievous terror. Preserve me from the black sleep of sin; all earthly and evil thoughts put to sleep within me. 

Grant to me light sleep, rid of all imaginations fleshly and satanical. Lord, Thou knowest how sleepless are mine unseen foes, and how feeble my wretched flesh, who madest me; shelter me with the wings of Thy pity. Awaken me at the fitting time, at the time of prayer: and give me to seek Thee early, for Thy glory and for Thy service. 

Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commend myself, my spirit, soul and body: Thou didst make and didst redeem them. And together with me, all my friends and all that belongs to me. Thou hast vouchsafed them to me, Lord, in Thy goodness. Guard my lying down and my rising up from henceforth and for ever. Let me remember Thee on my bed and search out my spirit; let me wake up and be present with Thee. Let me lay me down in peace and take my rest: for it is Thou, Lord, only, that makest me dwell in safety.

## Sunday Prayer
Through the tender mercies of our God the dayspring from on high hath visited us. 

Glory be to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee, Creator of the light and enlightener of the world,—of the visible light, the sun's ray, a flame of fire, day and night, evening and morning;—of the light invisible, the revelation of God, writings of the Law, oracles of prophets, music of psalms, instruction of proverbs, experience of histories; a light which never sets. 

O by Thy Resurrection raise us up into newness of life, supplying to us frames of repentance. The God of peace, who did bring again from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect us in every good work to do His will, working in us what is acceptable before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. 

Thou who didst send down on Thy disciples on this day Thy thrice-holy Spirit, withdraw not Thou the gift, O Lord, from us, but renew it in us, day by day, who ask Thee for it. 

I commend to Thee, my Lord, my impulses and my startings, my intentions and my attempts, my going out and my coming in, my sitting down and my rising up.
