My theory: when there's a choice to be made between very similar options, the majority will choose the better name. That's how I predicted Blu-ray would beat out HD-DVD. 

This one's not as easy, but I'll guess again before reading the article. I predict Seaford (simple, evocative, easy to spell) will beat out Tenorite (poor band name), Bierstadt (hard to spell), Skeena (sounds like "skeevy"), and Grandview (great but sounds like a serif).

After reading the article, I really like Seaford but I would pick Tenorite for a default. I'm just not sure that the name is good enough.
