## About

The RSAA is named for two Richards who wrote stories about anthropomorphic animals (or as I have called them since childhood, "animals in hats"). 

Richard Adams most famously wrote *Watership Down*, which features rabbits and other animals that are presented as completely real animals, aside from human-like thoughts.

Richard Scarry wrote stories for young children set in Busytown, an idyllic cartoon town populated by animals that are completely human in every way except appearance.
