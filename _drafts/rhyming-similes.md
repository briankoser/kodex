As snug as a thug in a hug
As loose as a goose in a noose
As odd as a cod in a hod
As fine as a swine in a brine
As dark as a narc in a shark
As good as as a dude in a hood
As cool as a fool in a pool
As bleak as a week on the creek
As done as a bun in the sun
As clean as a bean with a sheen
As funky as a junkie monkey
As wrong as King Kong in a thong
