# Chapter 1. Discovery

Terry Pratchett wrote thirty-two Discworld books without chapters. "I just never got into the habit of chapters." His plots zip along and don't suffer for the lack of regular breaks, but it is a noticeable difference from other modern novelists.

Terry Pratchett's thirty-third Discworld book does have chapters. But again he breaks with most of his peers. After two prologues (The Nine-Thousand-Year Prologue and the One-Month Prologue), here's how the first chapter starts:

# Chapter 1
## The Angel
☞ In which our hero experiences Hope, the greatest gift ❄ The bacon sandwich of regret ❄ Somber reflections on capital punishment from the hangman ❄ Famous last words ❄ Our hero dies ❄ Angels, conversations about ❄ Inadvisability of misplaced offers regarding broomsticks ❄ An unexpected ride ❄ A world free of honest men ❄ A man on the hop ❄ There is always a choice

The effect here is old-timey and interest-piquing. I've since found this technique used in other modern books to similarly amusing effect. Also, in older works where spoilers are not a concern, for a more straightforward orientation for the reader.

# Chapter 2. Names

But what are these bullet-pointed chapter summaries called? [I asked the question on Literature Stack Exchange](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-are-chapter-summary-phrases-called) in 2017. 

DukeZhou suggested this is an "argument". The Loeb Classical Library includes an argument before each Greek drama: a one or two-page summary of the play to help new readers follow the narrative ([example](https://archive.org/details/L146NAeschylusIIOresteiaAgamemnonEumenides/page/4/mode/2up)).

[Webster's 1828 Dictionary says](https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/argument) an argument can be, "An abstract or summary of a book, or the heads of the subjects".
