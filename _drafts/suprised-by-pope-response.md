My thoughts on The Sci-Fi Christian's podcast [Episode 944: Surprised By Pope](http://thescifichristian.com/2021/07/episode-944-surprised-by-pope/):



Catholics say salvation comes from grace through the sacraments. Protestants say salvation comes from grace through a sinner's prayer.

Curation: choosing your influence
Protestants overestimate their ability to make decisions independently. Protestants are also submitting to the tradition of family, denonimation, church, pastors and thinkers. The Bible is not the only authority. We are not tabula rasas.

Submitting to a curated list doesn't mean pretending to like everything, but you should try to find what you missed. Humility. "The church sees something here that I do not."

We are the church. The ideal is to start with a curated list and move beyond: start by accepting the 

Papal infallibility - are there more than Immaculate Conception and Assumption of Mary? Papal infallibility is a tautology: if it is later determined to be heretical, then it was not ex cathedra. 

The Sixth General Council excommunicated Pope Honorius I for heresy

Long time periods are a good argument for Catholicism. Counter: acceleration of history

Sola scriptura: what do you do with the hundreds of years before the canon was formed?

Side note: Moses didn't write Genesis and the Bible doesn't say he did (it says he wrote the law and at least a portion of Deut)

Deuterocanon

If the Holy Spirit preserves doctrine through apostolic succession / councils, now we know what's true 

Catholic doctrine is usually negative theology, ruling things out
