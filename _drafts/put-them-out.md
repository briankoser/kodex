There's one grammar rule I always break: placing commas and periods inside quotation marks. I prefer the British style; it's clearer.

American style: Critics describe the film as "pretentious," "garbled," and "unnecessary."

British style: Critics describe the film as "pretentious", "garbled", and "unnecessary".

The American style looks "off". Worse, it can be inaccurate. Technical documentation example:

> To sign up, enter your email address and click "Register."

Obviously the button should read "Register", but technically the requirement is to include a period.

> Remove every ",", ".", and ":" from the web page.

How would you write that in the American style?

You might be saying, "This is a trivial detail that would only cause a problem once in a million instances". If you said that, then you're not a software developer. My job is to worry about small details and to be as precise as possible. And as a former co-worker likes to say, "One in a million happens every week."

Basically, I'd rather be clear than "correct".
