## Misconceptions

### The soul or spirit is our true self
He said we can see the soul is a part of us, not our "true self", in verses like Ps. 103: "Praise the LORD O my soul".

### There is no difference between soul and spirit
St. Augustine, following Plato and Aristotle, said we die when our soul leaves our body. The soul is immortal.

### We can draw hard lines between body, soul, and spirit

# The tripartite human

## Body

## Spirit

## Soul
The soul is the connection between a human and God.
