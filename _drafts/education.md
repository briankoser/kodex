Like all good parents, I would say I want a good education for my children. By that I don't mean I want them to go to renowned, expensive schools, although that can certainly be part of it. I mean there are things I want them to learn. Things I learned in school. Things I *didn't* learn in school. 

Here's what I want you to know, Lydia. Here's the plan:

# Reading 

## Level 1: Literacy
By far the most important skill. If you know how to read, you can teach yourself anything. **Phonics** is the way to go; it's best to get the rules so you can apply them to unfamiliar words.

## Level 2: Comprehension
The best way to acquire reading comprehension is to read everything. Books, newspaper articles, blog posts. Fiction, non-fiction. Pieces in genres you like, pieces in genres you don't like, pieces that are fun, pieces you don't understand, pieces that make you happy, pieces that make you sad, pieces translated from other languages, pieces from long ago. Look up words you don't know. Talk to others about what you're reading (book reports or reviews, book clubs, conversations with friends).

## Level 3: Literature
What makes a classic a classic? Why are we still reading The Iliad and The Odyssey almost 3,000 years after they were written? [Ben de Bono]() suggests several criteria for determining if a work is a classic:

- 1
- 2
- 3

Reading literature will make you a better, more well-rounded person. I realize that sounds vague and wishy-washy, but questions like, "Why is art important?" are bigger that the scope of this piece.

# Writing

## Level 1: Physical
While we write on paper less than we did one hundred years ago, I think it's still a worthwhile skill. After you can write legibly and quickly, I think you've gone far enough, unless you're personally interested in penmanship and calligraphy.

If we're still using keyboards, you should probably pick that up as well.

## Level 2: Structure
Crossing over with your reading skills, you'll want to learn grammar so you can follow the rules when you write. I'll tell you a secret if you'll keep it between us: grammar rules are completely arbitrary, they change over time, and it's not a sin to break them. But remember the words of Picasso: "Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist."

The best way to cement these rules and learn how to write? Read a lot. Then write a lot.

## Level 3: Forms
You'll write an essay differently than you'll write a story. You'll write a book review differently than you'll write a thank you note. Writing an email to your boss is different than writing an email to your friend. There's other types that you'll use rarely but really need to know, like the resume.

# Speaking
Entwined with reading and writing is speaking. You'll do plenty of this on your own. What you'll need to practice is speaking in front of people. If you can do that, you'll be fine.
