"I'm tired of being pregnant," I thought as I watched my husband eat all the sushi he wanted. "Tired of watching what I eat, and watching my husband eat what I can't have but so desperately desire. Maybe we should be done with children after this one."

"That was awful!" I groaned after going through yet another Pitocin-heavy labor, and enduring lonely hours during recovery in the hospital while hooked up to machines. "I don't know that I want to go through it ever again."

"I'm done with this!" I cried as I dealt with breastfeeding issues all over again, all while sleep-deprived and hormonally unstable. "We're not having any more children!"

"Maybe just one more child," I thought as I snuggled my baby's soft head against my cheek, and gazed down at her tiny, trusting face.
