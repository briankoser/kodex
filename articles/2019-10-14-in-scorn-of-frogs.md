excerpt: Bulky and droopy, slimy and gloopy, frogs are a blight to the eye.

Bulky and droopy, slimy and gloopy, frogs are a blight to the eye.

Constantly croakin', with voices all broken, they're rude, nasty, and sly.

With tongues that zip out, and webbed feet which they flout, so ugly they make us all cry.

The tadpole swam off, his head held aloft, "A frog I'll never be, no, not I!"
