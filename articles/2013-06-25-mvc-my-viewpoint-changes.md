Last time I wrote about how much I like the beginning of a project. Opening up all the cans of tech and getting a big whiff of that new technology smell…*sniff* Aaaah. Well, I liked choosing the technologies for my new project so much, that I decided to do it again!

Ruby on Rails seems like a great framework. I had fun messing around with it, reading blogs, doing the tutorials. Great fun. But it’s June. Almost July. Four months later, and I’m still working through tutorials.

This isn’t really a Ruby on Rails issue so much as a technology-that-I-don’t-know issue and a I-don’t-have-copious-amounts-of-free-time-to-learn-this-technology issue. I do have a life beyond programming, and at this point, I just want to start building this website. So, new requirements:

1. Something I already know, or at least close, so I can actually get the project done
2. Something new (to me at least)

And, most importantly,

Behold, ASP.NET MVC. Careful, don’t let the sheer power of all those capital letters overwhelm you. For me, ASP.NET MVC is sort of a compromise between learning something completely new, like Rails, and using something I already know, like ASP.NET Webforms.

So I’ll be using ASP.NET MVC with Azure. I’ll still probably use Ember as well. We’ll see how far I get this time before deciding to switch to node.js or meteor or…
