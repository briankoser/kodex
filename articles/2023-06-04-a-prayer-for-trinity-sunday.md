God, today we confess our belief in you, one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity. 

We know you are Love because of the love you have shown from Father to Son, from Son to Father, and because of the love you have shown to all mankind. 

Draw us into yourself, transform us, and work your love through us into the world.

Amen.
