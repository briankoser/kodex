Merry Christmas everyone! You're likely reading this at the end of Advent or during the Twelve Days of Christmas. Amidst the waiting and celebrating of the season, we've taken a few minutes to reflect on the year as it draws to an end.

2024 was another full year. In January, we visited family in Mobile and Pensacola. Brian continued working on his new project at work, and was as busy as he's ever been in his career.

In January and February, Brian helped revamp the [House of Humane Letters](https://houseofhumaneletters.com/) online registration system. There were a few tense moments (like it's-three-days-before-registration-starts-and-maybe-we-need-to-scrap-everything-and-use-the-old-system tense), but they finished by registration day and the system worked fairly smoothly. Success!

Otherwise, we stayed close to home and kept it low-key before it was time to meet our newest daughter. Our friend Louise volunteered to watch the girls when it was time to go to the hospital. On the 20th, when Melissa's water broke at 3 am, we called and Louise arrived 10 minutes later! Less than six hours after that, Verity Hope Koser was born.

Verity had some early struggles with gaining weight and with her neck, but has been a cheerful sweetheart through it all.

Brian got four weeks of paternity leave and took on most of the household chores and the homeschooling. Melissa focused on Verity and her own recovery.

In May, we decided to turn the play room into a bedroom for Lydia and Amber. With the space separate from the younger sisters came a later bed time and extra bedtime stories. Lydia's favorite of the year was ???; Amber enjoyed ??? the most.

In June, we again travelled to Mobile and Pensacola, this time to introduce baby Verity to the family. Unlike the previous summer, Brian continued running through the heat and completed his first trail runs.

In July, Lydia and Amber, with some friends from our homeschool co-op, performed in a musical about Queen Esther.

On the spur of the moment, Brian signed up for a month-long online class about The Brothers Karamazov through [The House of Humane Letters](https://houseofhumaneletters.com/). Other books and projects had to go on hold, but it was worth it to blaze through the novel and hear Dr. Jason Baxter's lectures.

In August, we finally visited Brian's sister Lindsey and family in Missouri! We visited a swimming hole, an amusement park, and an enormous Bass Pro Shop with an entire aquarium inside. Also, lots of just hanging out while the girls ran around outside with their cousins. It was one of our most memorable vacations.

In the fall, Melissa got the opportunity to take a beginner course in Russian!

In September, the girls hosted a tea party for a few ladies from church. Everyone was delighted with the event and agreed it deserved a repeat.

In October, our friend Louise was hospitalized. When she moved to a rehab center, we made Thursdays "Dinner with Louise" days, which brightened all our spirits. Brian flew to Minnesota for a weekend to see old friends, meet new friends, and run his first 10-mile race. Melissa hosted a Sip and Savor party where she shared her favorite probiotic food and drinks with seven other ladies.

November was a busy month of dinners with friends, end-of-term exams for the school girls, and driving to Indiana for a Binzel Thanksgiving!

In December, Brian built a website for a friend that opened a used bookstore in Huntsville! Check it out at https://thebookwyrmhsv.com/. While caught up in the website building fever he added a few updates to our own website, notably a [calendar](https://koser.us/calendar) and a [dictionary](https://koser.us/dictionary).

Lydia and Amber finished a project they started in September: the Huntsville Kid's Marathon. They ran with mom or dad a couple miles a week, up to 25.2 miles. Then on a sunny December day, they ran the final mile to complete their marathon! Brian ran a new longest race: his first half marathon.

Amid the Advent joy, we bid a sad goodbye to our friend Louise. For the girls, it was the first death of someone close. We mourned with our church family but also celebrated the sure hope that we will meet her again.

We're travelling to Louisiana for Christmas and will update this letter after the trip.

If you want to hear Brian and Melissa talk about the year, including our favorite books and films of the year, and our plans for the next, [check out our podcast](https://koser.us/podcasts) over the next few weeks.

Much love from Brian, Melissa, Lydia, Amber, Penelope, Susanna, and Verity
