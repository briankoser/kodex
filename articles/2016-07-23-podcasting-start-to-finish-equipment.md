Recently we started a podcast: [Ten to One](http://tto.koser.us), where we make top ten lists about everything ([check it out!](http://tto.koser.us)). We try for the highest quality possible; for content, of course, but also for the audio quality and editing. In case you want to start a podcast, or just do some intermediate audio recording and editing, I’m going to write a series of articles detailing how we do it. Let’s start with the equipment.

You can record audio on your smart phone or laptop, but high-quality audio requires better equipment. If you’re just recording one person you should get:

# Microphone
We use the [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJOZS4), a cheap but good quality mic.

# Microphone stand
The ATR2100 does come with a small stand, but we wanted something sturdier that wouldn’t pick up every table bump. The [On Stage Tripod Boom Microphone Stand (MS7701B)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000978D58) is a floor-standing tripod that works with our mic, although it requires a:

# Microphone clip
The [On Stage Microphone Clip (MY325)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZO60I) attaches to the stand and actually holds the mic.

# Pop filter
To prevent plosives (“P” and “B” sounds, which are made with a burst of air from the mouth) from making a popping sound when they hit the mic. The [Dragonpad USA Pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AOH1O6) is big and cheap and works.

# Headphones
Not a necessity, but it does help you know exactly what your mic is picking up. You can plug them directly into the ATR2100.

The nice thing about the one-person setup is how easy it is to plug everything together:

Just plug the mic into the computer and you’re off to the races.

However, with two people it’s a little awkward recording into one mic. The downside to adding a mic is that you can’t just plug it in to a second USB port. It’s important that the audio from both mics goes in simultaneously, but USB does not transfer at consistent speeds. You’ll need to plug the mics into a mixer which will combine the audio and send it to the computer. Our new setup includes the existing equipment plus:

# An additional mic, stand, clip, and pop filter
Same models.

# Mixer
We use the [Behringer Xenyx Q802USB](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Q802USB). The mixer will take the audio from both mics and pipe it into your computer through USB.

# 1/4″ to 1/8″ cable
Like the [Hosa 1/8″ TRS to Two Mono 1/4″ Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068O3C). We use this to connect audio from our laptop to the mixing board. This allows us to record Skype conversations or other audio played from the computer.

# Headphone adapter
The [RCA AH216 Stereo headphone adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005T3GH) allows you to plug your headphones into the mixer.

The new setup looks like this:

I’ve never used a mixer, so I’ll have to go figure it out before I write part two. 😎
