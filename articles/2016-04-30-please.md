This is why I use an ad-blocker:

But if someone asks nicely, I don’t mind turning it off.

No problem, Nicolás.

Sure, Louis. Glad to do it.

Sometimes they give you a choice:

<figure>  <img alt="Wired asks that you either unblock ads or pay $1 per month" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-04-30-blocker-wired.png" />  <figcaption>Wired makes you choose</figcaption>  </figure>  

Whitelist or pay. That’s fair. Nothing is free.

Sometimes they don’t ask:
<figure>  <img alt="Smashing Magazine says they use ad blockers" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-04-30-blocker-smashing-magazine.png" />  <figcaption>Smashing Magazine makes an observation</figcaption>  </figure>

OK…so you don’t mind if I use an ad-blocker? Cool.

<figure>  <img alt="The Washington Post tells you that your ad-blocker is on" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-04-30-blocker-washington-post.png" />  <figcaption>The Washington Post makes an observation</figcaption>  </figure>  

Why yes. Yes it is on. And it will stay on. Developer tools, inspect, delete element.
