This is why I use an ad-blocker:

But if someone asks nicely, I don’t mind turning it off.

No problem, Nicolás.

Sure, Louis. Glad to do it.

Sometimes they give you a choice:

Whitelist or pay. That’s fair. Nothing is free.

Sometimes they don’t ask:

OK…so you don’t mind if I use an ad-blocker? Cool.

Why yes. Yes it is on. And it will stay on. Developer tools, inspect, delete element.
