Have you heard of <a href="https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/">The 5 Whys</a>? It's a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">Six Sigma</a> technique for discovering the root of a problem. Each "why" gets you past surface effects and closer to the cause.

It sounded good in theory, so I tried it on Lydia the other night when she didn't want to put her pajamas on.
