It's easy to do this yourself if you are connected to someone with an IMDb page. At that point, you can use [The Oracle of Bacon](https://oracleofbacon.org/), which used to calculate connections to [Kevin Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon), but now calculates connections between any two actors with Wikipedia pages.
