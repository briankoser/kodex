## Personal
- Day trip to McKay's Books and the Nashville Zoo
- First month in our Sunday School teaching rotation
- Grilled shrimp for poboys
- Watched *Star Wars* with Lydia
- First business trip in two years
- Men's activity: first time at Top Golf ("keep your eye on the ball" is a clich√© for a reason)
- Memorized Donne's Holy Sonnet XIV
- Three-day trip to Mobile to visit family and attend a work dinner

## My Thoughts
- Tanagers are beautiful birds.
- There is a special joy in arguing minutia.
- God told Moses to make cherubim on the side of the Ark of the Covenant: Moses knew what cherubim looked like.
- Atheists argue that Christians are 99% atheist, and atheists believe in only one fewer god. That's like someone who believes that no one wrote the Shakespeare plays arguing that they believe in only one fewer author than the Shakespeare believer.
- Moderns make a strong divide between fiction and non-fiction, but communication is never objective. The dryest history book's factions were filtered by the author.

## Notes
- Angelina Stanford
  - When he died, C. S. Lewis was considered the best-read man in the world.
  - Moderns see classics as museum pieces; medievals saw classics as living soil from which could grow new Christian culture.
  - Monks dies to preserve Homer, Virgil, Aristotle, and Plato.
  - C. S. Lewis said literature is not a line, but a circle. You need not read chronologically.
  - Let students make the literary connections.
  - No one in the Middle Ages read children's versions of Dante or Homer, they read the stories that prepared them for the classics.
  - Education is not a box to fill. Education is eyes to see.
- Ben De Bono: Leaders must empower followers instead of making all their decisions.
- Cindy Rollins
  - If Shakespeare and the other classics are elitist, why wouldn't you want to give them to your children (and as many children as possible)?
  - Charlotte Mason said self-consciousness is part of the Fall. We should never contribute to a child's self-consciousness.
- Doug Wilson
  - You are saved by justification by faith. You are not saved by believing in justification by faith.
  - Catholics believe grace is infused, Protestants believe grace is imputed.
- Pam Barnhill: A child is not a problem to be solved.
- After World War II, American churches raised funds to help rebuild European churches by buying their shattered stained glass, which they used to make new windows.

## Quotes
- "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested." -- Francis Bacon
- "The greatest thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one's 'own' or 'real' life. The truth is of course that what one calls the interruptions are precisely one's real life--the life God is sending one day by day; what one calls one's 'real life' is a phantom of one's own imagination." -- C. S. Lewis

## Words
- Lemniscate: figure-eight shape
