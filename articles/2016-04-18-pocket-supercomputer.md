Now that I have a supercomputer in my pocket (currently a [Google Nexus 5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5)), life is less cluttered. I no longer need to carry:

- paper
- pen
- flashlight

Travel with:
- maps
- GPS
- laptop

Own:
- calculator
- camera
- video recorder
- Gameboy
- dictionary
- encyclopedia
- MP3 player
- watch
- pager
- alarm clock
- level
- barcode scanner
- calendar
- day planner

Memorize:
- addresses
- phone numbers
- social security numbers
- license plate numbers
- birthdays
- credit card numbers
- first aid

It could replace:
- TV
- books

…although I still own a TV and shelves of books.

I expect it will eventually replace:
- keys
- wallet
