Inkscape is vector-drawing software. Vector graphics are different than the more common raster graphics. A raster graphic like a JPG says, “The top left pixel is blue. The next pixel to the right is red. The next pixel…” A vector graphic says, “There’s a blue line from the top left to the right of the image. There’s a red circle whose diameter is half the length of the line.”

Vector graphics are superior to raster graphics for things like illustrations. You know how when you zoom into a photograph it eventually gets blurry? That’s because you’re just making the pixels bigger. A vector graphic is just a description of how to build an image, so you can zoom forever without getting blurry; the image will just re-draw at the new size.

Inkscape is really the only game in town for free vector drawing. I’ve used it for things like the logo of our podcast, [Ten to One](http://tto.koser.us). That’s why I donated my October creators donation to Inkscape.
