Matthew 14:16-19
<ol start="16">
<li>Then saith he unto his disciples, Give unto these provision.
<li>And his disciples saith, Lord, wherewith shall we feed these? We have but five loaves, two fishes, and some broccoli.
<li>The Lord saith, Give me the bread and fishes. And the disciples marvelled at his wisdom.
<li>And again he saith, Get thee behind me broccoli. Unto his disciples he saith, Let it alone: it is from the Devilâ€™s garden.
</ol>
These verses mean a lot to me.
