I'm reading *The Hobbit* to the girls at bedtime, and then reading the annotations from *The Annotated Hobbit* after they go to bed. The author, Douglas Anderson, [recently wrote](http://ashiverinthearchives.blogspot.com/2023/07/how-to-correctly-pronounce-names-like.html) about an old book he found titled *What’s the Name, Please? A Guide to the Correct Pronunciation of Current Prominent Names*.

I immediately found a copy on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/whatsnamepleaseg0000char/mode/2up) and skimmed through looking for familiar names. Here are the names that I've been pronouncing incorrectly:

Also of note, the epigraph is a few fun lines from the poem ["The March to Moscow"](http://www.poetryatlas.com/poetry/poem/3187/the-march-to-moscow.html), poking at the difficulty English speakers have with Russian names:

<p class="poem">And last of all an Admiral came,<br>
A terrible man with a terrible name,—<br>
A name which you all know by sight very well;<br>
But which no one can speak, and no one can spell.</p>
