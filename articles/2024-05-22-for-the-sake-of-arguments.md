## Chapter 1. Discovery

Terry Pratchett wrote thirty-two Discworld books without chapters. "I just never got into the habit of chapters." His plots zip along and don't suffer for the lack of regular breaks, but this difference stands out among modern novels.

Terry Pratchett's thirty-third Discworld book does have chapters. But again he breaks with most of his peers. After two prologues (The Nine-Thousand-Year Prologue and the One-Month Prologue), here's how the first chapter starts:

The effect here is old-timey and interest-piquing. I've since found this technique used in other modern books, usually again for amusing effect. In older works where spoilers are not a concern, I've seen them used to orient the reader.

## Chapter 2. Names

But what are these bullet-pointed chapter summaries called? I figured there was a more specific term than "summary" or "synopsis".

### Epigraphs

[Webster's 1913](http://www.websters1913.com/words/Epigraph) says an epigraph is, "A citation...placed at the beginning of a work or of its separate divisions." This is close, but the *Going Postal* summaries don't come from another work (not even another fictional work, like in *Dune*).

### Bridgeheads

While browsing "The Standard Ebooks Manual of Style" (as one does), I found the term ["bridgehead"](https://standardebooks.org/manual/1.8.0/7-high-level-structural-patterns#7.2.11):

> Bridgeheads are sections in a chapter header that give an abstract or summary of the following chapter. They may be in prose or in a short list with clauses separated by em dashes.

And for an example, the guide lists the bridgehead for *Three Men in a Boat*, which the second book in which I found this technique. Case solved?

As far as I can tell, "bridgehead" in the sense of chapter headings was coined for hypertext. My guess is Standard Ebooks got the term from either [DocBook](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/bridgehead) or [The DAISY Consortium](https://daisy.org/guidance/info-help/guidance-training/standards/daisy-structure-guidelines-elements-block-elements-information-object-bridgehead/).

A term that existed when these books were written would be preferable...

### Arguments

[I asked this question on Literature Stack Exchange](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-are-chapter-summary-phrases-called) back in 2017. DukeZhou suggested these are examples of "arguments". The Loeb Classical Library includes an argument before each Greek drama: a one or two-page summary of the play to help new readers follow the narrative ([example](https://archive.org/details/L146NAeschylusIIOresteiaAgamemnonEumenides/page/4/mode/2up)).

[Webster's 1828 Dictionary says](https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/argument) an argument can be, "An abstract or summary of a book, or the heads of the subjects". [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_(literature)) provides the example of the book summaries Milton wrote for the second edition of *Paradise Lost*:

{% argument arguments.paradiseLost %}

When writing about "spoilers" being a modern concept, [Kelly Cumbee](https://badgermum.blogspot.com/2024/01/spoilers.html) mentioned that *Orlando Furioso* opens each book with an argument. (That post impelled me to finish this piece, which sat as a draft for years!)

Argument is the right answer, but I do wish there were a term for arguments in lists instead of paragraphs. I propose to call them "bulleted arguments".
