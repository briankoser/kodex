## Notes
- Jonathan and Mathieu Pageau, What is Symbolism?
  - Symbols are not material and scientific, but also not personal and subjective. They are universal.
  - If you want people to care about your story, use universal symbols.
  - Symbols are inescapable. Scientists are mediators between heaven (theory) and earth (physical).
  - Patterns repeated at different level of reality.
  - You can abstract yourself out to do some physical study, but there are limits. Quantum: observers impact observations.
  - What does it mean, "go up into heaven"? Doesn't mean float into space. Can't interpret materialistically.
  - Dante says the cosmology of spheres is a condescension of heavenly reality.
  - "Earth" meant matter. When we realized there was matter outside earth, we split those terms. Word meanings shift.
  - "Jonah didn't get swallowed by a whale, because the Bible says it was a fish, and whales aren't fish." Definition changed.
  - Snake in the garden is a symbol of time. Time is the cause of transformation. Time is change. Cyclical transformation of things to their opposites. Not a metaphor. The snake caused a change.
  - Symbols are not metaphors and not arbitrary.
  - Symbols are more important that "what really happened".
  - The Bible is communicating truth, not history.
  - The Flood, the Red Sea, the Rubicon, the Deleware: crossing water to symbolize change of power. Doesn't mean Washington didn't cross the Deleware, but the symbol is more important than the "fact". Arguing if it happened misses the point.
  - It's okay if some Bible stories are fictional.
  - Symbolism is the union of fact and meaning.
  - Modernism isn't disenchantment: it is deincarnation, the splitting of the physical and spiritual.
  - Scientists care about theory and fact, and so are best at preserving the union. But they are materialists, so theory is not real.
  - Mathematical pattern is more real and universal than any observable fact.
  - Criteria for a real symbol/connection: exactly the same as determining valid science.
    - Consistent: works everywhere
    - Comprehensive: many examples (if it's fundamental, it will appear many times)
    - Insightful: gives more understanding instead of just a code for something else
      - Symbols are meant to reveal, not hide
- Orthodox Diary
  - Moderns simplify medieval Christendom, overly-demonize modernism
  - Crusades were not wholly bad or good
  - Wokeism is moral absolutism, not relativism
  - If Aquinas is Catholicism, Catholicism started in the 13th century
  - Catholicism is a response to Protestantism
  - Great Schism didn't change much in practice
  - "Much of the Catholic 'development of doctrine' that occurred after Thomas Aquinas and especially after the Reformation is an attempt to grapple with emergent modernity."
- Angelina Stanford
  - Epic hero is semi-divine, fated for greatness, withstands the gods. Romantic hero is everyman, set apart by character not birth.
  - World War I was caused by Christian, classically-educated leaders. You still need virtue.
  - Since all knowledge is connected, there is no such thing as a sidetrack.
  - Picaresque is a wandering journey, not a quest.
  - Stories don't work mechanistically. You don't become a murderer by reading murder mysteries. Not everyone that reads the Bible becomes virtuous.
  - Modern Christians say we need to take sin more seriously: medievals said we take sin and ourselves to seriously. We should laugh at evil, like we do at Mr. Toad.
- Cindy Rollins
  - Will reading about bad characters make children bad? Too late, they're already bad. 
  - The Bible isn't a character study.
- Bryce Young: Everyone is in Adam or Christ: a child cannot be un-elect and in Christ.
- Alastair Roberts: Baptism compared to a wedding, a coronation, an adoption
- Thomas Banks: If books can save your soul, Jesus should have become a novelist.
- Peter Zeihan via Doug Wilson: The US has 17 thousand miles of navigable rivers. The rest of the world combined has 16 thousand.
