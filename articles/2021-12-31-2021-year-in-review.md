First time doing one of these Years in Review! I'm subtitling 2021, "Restart". 

## Life

COVID-19 was still a thing, but by the end of the year, it's direct effect on us was close to none. I continued to work from home, and now have an office!

I dropped my phone in a lawn mower and couldn't get it replaced for a couple months. It's a long story...but the upside is I broke the habit of checking my phone incessantly.

We moved from southern Alabama to northern Alabama. New church, new friends, new adventures.

I got heavy into Christian classical education as we started our first grade homeschool with Lydia.

## Articles I Wrote

Only wrote one article this year, based on a presentation I gave at work on [Astro static sites](https://koser.us/articles/2021/08/19/1/astro-static-sites-30/).

## Favorite Articles I Read
- [Thoughts on Narrative Framing Devices](https://koser.us/notes/20210325095900/) by Chris Gerwel
- [Which type of novelty-seeking web developer are you?](https://koser.us/notes/20210321171400/) by Baldur Bjarnason
- [How to Write Things people actually want to read](https://koser.us/notes/20210426160800/) by James Sinclair
- [Embrace the Grind](https://koser.us/notes/20210525172100/) by Jacob Kaplan-Moss 
- [Own the Tools](https://koser.us/notes/20210704095700/) by David Cain
- [Fertility And Humanityâ€™s Failure](https://koser.us/notes/20210922062215/) by Rod Dreher

## Notes
My biggest contribution to the world was [Koser's Theory of Leftovers](https://koser.us/notes/20210427131500/): At midnight, leftovers are redistributed evenly.

[I wrote some APIs, which were correct 200% of the time.](https://koser.us/notes/20211013111100/)

My broinlaw Josh introduced me to this [Starburst Berries and Cream](https://koser.us/notes/20210426153900/) ad. As much as I was in to silly commercials in college, I have no idea how this one escaped my notice.

## Books
Stay tuned for a podcast episode on my 2021 books (coming January)

## Film
Stay tuned for a podcast episode on our 2021 films (coming January)

## Podcasts
We recorded only 14 episodes for [Ten to One}(https://tto.koser.us) this year, but we did appear on 10+ episodes of [The Sci-Fi Christian](http://thescifichristian.com/).

Listening-wise, I got into a bunch of classical Christian education podcasts: Consortium Podcast, The Everlasting Education, Digressio Podcast, and New Humanists. All recommended.

## Metrics
- Unique books read: 1173

## 2022
I'm going to stop tracking metrics that, on reflection, I don't really care about, like how many to do tasks I'm accomplishing.

Fewer goals, but build some daily and weekly habits with longterm effects, like reading a poem every day.

Continue developing our homeschool curriculum, and create a web page for it.

Be more social. Basically I need to cultivate more male friendships to offset the upcoming addition of another baby girl to the house. :)
