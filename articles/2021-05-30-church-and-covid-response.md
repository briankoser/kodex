Hi Scott,

Thanks always for the thoughtful writing. The relationship between the Church and the State is an underdeveloped topic in my worldview, so I appreciate hearing the variety of perspectives.

The church seizures and arrests are horrible. Praise God the survival rate is extremely high for COVID-19, as you observed. And I appreciate those who watch for the erosion of personal freedom.

I do think most of these topics exist in a continuum instead of a dichotomy, with few easy answers. 

Okay for a church to skip meeting one week (say for a hurricane); not okay for a church to never meet in-person. No church for fear of automobile accidents is wrong; church meeting while spreading a 90% mortality rate-plague would also be wrong. How to balance responsibility with freedom? How long can a church meet virtually? If COVID-22 happens next year with a bubonic-level mortality rate, is the government justified in locking down to promote the general welfare?

I hope Christians from all backgrounds continue to unify and work through these questions. 






As with most things, I think the possible responses exist in a continuum instead of a dichotomy. Some churches made no changes or closed out of fear of the government; some continued meeting with precautions or stopped meeting because they felt it was responsible.

As with a lot of things, I find it difficult to nail down a spot in the continuum. A church that skipped meeting one week (say, for a natural disaster) is okay; a church that never meets in person is not okay. Where is the breaking point in between? A church that stopped meeting for fear of automobile accidents would be wrong; a church that continued meeting while spreading bubonic plague would also be wrong. Where is the line between fearful overcaution and negligent selfishness?


 Would you advise a different action for a higher mortality rate, or would the responsibility to meet in-person always trump?

The difficulty with a pandemic situation is determining when promoting the general welfare requires a lessening of personal freedom.
