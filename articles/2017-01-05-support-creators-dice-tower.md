Melissa and I have been into modern board games for a few years now. We’re hovering at around 100 games in our collection, keeping about 95% of our purchases. The main reason for this great success rate is [The Dice Tower](www.dicetower.com).

The Dice Tower is the biggest board game media company (at least in English) and certainly the best. They do a podcast where they talk about all things board games. Another great resource is their video review channel on YouTube. For most games we’re interested in they have a video showing the basics of how the game is played and talking about whether or not they like the game.

Another fun series is their Top Ten lists: check out the Top Ten Essential Games if you’re new to the hobby.

For those interested in hearing about new games on a weekly basis, the most efficient way is to watch the Week In Review videos, where the Dice Tower crew gives 15-second overviews of all games reviewed that week.

For being a great resource of information, as well as some of the kindest and most fun people around, I made The Dice Tower our Creator Donation for January 2017.
