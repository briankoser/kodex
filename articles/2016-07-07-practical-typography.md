If you use Microsoft Word or build websites and have never learned the basics of typography, I’d like you to check out Matthew Butterick’s [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/)
. You’ll learn about things like margins, punctuation, bold vs. italics, fonts, and get specific recommendations for documents like résumés. Each section is short with practical recommendations and examples. Butterick does present these topics as rules, even when much of the subject matter is opinion. But that’s a good thing for beginners: you’ve got to learn the rules before you can break them. Not interested in typography? At least check out his [Typography in ten minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) cheat sheet. Consider this an intervention.
