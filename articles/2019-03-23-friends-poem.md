# Rachel
<pre>Vivacious, friendly, and warm,
Creative, helping, and bright.
She does much, without much thanks,
But when she’s gone, she’s greatly missed.</pre>

# Holly
<pre>Mild and cheerful, caring and kind,
She is a friend you can always rely on.
Balanced in mind with a sweet charming humor,
Time spent with her is ever a pleasure.</pre>  

# Catherine
<pre>Laughing and cheeky to bring out your grin,
Sparkling with fun is this girlfriend to me.
Always a hand she is willing to lend,
Along with her smile that brightens the mood.</pre>

# Judy
<pre>Quiet, shy, not craving your notice,
Witty, fair, a pearl among pebbles.
Her thoughts are of others, never herself,
She’s the gentlest and sweetest of any I’ve met.</pre>

# Tina
<pre>Often the start of a fun, hearty joke,
She’ll cheerily laugh at her own traits and quirks,
While caring and service are foremost in mind,
To shoulder your burdens and lighten your load.</pre>

# Charity
<pre>Sassy yet kind, fervent yet grounded,
Complex in spirit and sincere in soul.
Lovely of face and more lovely of heart,
Her family is ever her aim to uphold.</pre>

# Theresa
<pre>Exquisite in looks, such as only is dreamed of,
Yet pride or conceit will not ever portray her.
Strongly intelligent and musically gifted,
Talents and wits are delighting to all.</pre>

# Tristan
<pre>Recently met, yet such a dear heart!
Her smile is sunshine in every room.
A mother she is, and the word is high praise,
For she’s gentle and firm, tender and fun.</pre>
