I’m in the middle of setting up a Home Theatre PC for my living room. When I’m done, it will back up files from our other devices, record TV from our antennae and remove commercials, play music and Blu-Ray discs, play Steam games, and a few other tricks.

It’s a little tricky setting up the hardware and software for an HTPC, but I’ve found some good information online.

[My Media Experience](http://mymediaexperience.com) has been the most helpful resource. Tuukka provides some pretty in-depth tutorials for free, and to thank him, I’ve made My Media Experience my February creator donation.
