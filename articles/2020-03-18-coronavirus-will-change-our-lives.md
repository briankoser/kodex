Friday, March 13, 2020 is when I realized that COVID-19 was serious. (Of course it was Friday the 13th.)

Wednesday, March 18, 2020 is when I realized life will never be the same again.

Hopefully we get back to a normal soon. But it won't be the same normal, just like we can never go back to before 9/11. 

What will my children's lives be like? How different will their childhoods be than mine? How different their adult lives? I always blithely assumed they would live the same life I lived, even though that's obviously rubbish since I didn't have cell phones, social media, self-driving cars, or a hundred other things.

It's impossible to predict where all of this will lead, but I suspect that this is an inflection point for my generation. We have a lot to figure out so our children can live normally again.
