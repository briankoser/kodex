And the disciples marvelled at his wisdom. </li>  <li>And again he saith, Get thee behind me broccoli.

You’ll learn about things like margins, punctuation, bold vs. italics, fonts, and get specific recommendations for documents like résumés. Each section is short with practical recommendations and examples. Butterick does present these topics as rules, even when much of the subject matter is opinion. But that’s a good thing for beginners: you’ve got to learn the rules before you can break them. Not interested in typography? At least check out his <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">Typography in ten minutes</a> cheat sheet. Consider this an intervention.</p>

We try for the highest quality possible; for content, of course, but also for the audio quality and editing. In case you want to start a podcast, or just do some intermediate audio recording and editing, I’m going to write a series of articles detailing how we do it. Let’s start with the equipment.</p>  <p>You can record audio on your smart phone or laptop, but high-quality audio requires better equipment. If you’re just recording one person you should get:</p>  <h2 id="microphone">Microphone</h2>  <p>We use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJOZS4">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a>, a cheap but good quality mic.</p>  <h2 id="microphone-stand">Microphone stand</h2>  <p>The ATR2100 does come with a small stand, but we wanted something sturdier that wouldn’t pick up every table bump. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000978D58">On Stage Tripod Boom Microphone Stand (MS7701B)</a> is a floor-standing tripod that works with our mic, although it requires a:</p>  <h2 id="microphone-clip">Microphone clip</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZO60I">On Stage Microphone Clip (MY325)</a> attaches to the stand and actually holds the mic.</p>  <h2 id="pop-filter">Pop filter</h2>  <p>To prevent plosives (“P” and “B” sounds, which are made with a burst of air from the mouth) from making a popping sound when they hit the mic. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AOH1O6">Dragonpad USA Pop filter</a> is big and cheap and works.</p>  <h2 id="headphones">Headphones</h2>  <p>Not a necessity, but it does help you know exactly what your mic is picking up. You can plug them directly into the ATR2100.</p>  <div class="hr-container">      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 360 40" class="hr-image">          <circle cx="20"  cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="100" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="180" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="260" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="340" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />      </svg>      <hr class="visuallyhidden">  </div> <p>The nice thing about the one-person setup is how easy it is to plug everything together:</p>  <figure>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-07-23-podcasting-equipment-one-mic-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing how to connect one microphone to a computer">  </figure>    <p>Just plug the mic into the computer and you’re off to the races.</p>  <p>However, with two people it’s a little awkward recording into one mic. The downside to adding a mic is that you can’t just plug it in to a second USB port. It’s important that the audio from both mics goes in simultaneously, but USB does not transfer at consistent speeds. You’ll need to plug the mics into a mixer which will combine the audio and send it to the computer. Our new setup includes the existing equipment plus:</p>  <h2 id="an-additional-mic-stand-clip-and-pop-filter">An additional mic, stand, clip, and pop filter</h2>  <p>Same models.</p>  <h2 id="mixer">Mixer</h2>  <p>We use the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Q802USB">Behringer Xenyx Q802USB</a>.

We also have a budget item called “Creators”. It’s not a huge amount, but I make sure every month to give back to a creator who’s given me either practical value or just enjoyment. In addition I’m going to start writing about these folks each month as a further “Thank you”.</p>   <div class="hr-container">      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 360 40" class="hr-image">          <circle cx="20"  cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="100" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="180" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="260" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="340" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />      </svg>      <hr class="visuallyhidden">  </div>   <h2 id="dan-carlin">Dan Carlin</h2>    <p>Dan Carlin is one of the most successful professional podcasters. Both of his podcasts, Hardcore History and Common Sense, are quite popular (in the millions of listeners), and deservedly so.</p>    <p>Hardcore History is basically a series of audiobooks on topics such as the fall of the Roman Republic, World War I, and the Persian Empire. Dan is an excellent story teller with a great radio voice. He’s a self-proclaimed amateur historian, but he does a ton of research and presents a balanced view of history.</p>    <p>Common Sense is his political, current events podcast. The topics vary but civil liberties, terrorism, and government corruption are some of his favorites. We don’t agree on everything (who does?) but it’s always thought-provoking and, quite often, really just common sense.</p>    <p>Dan is able to make a living podcasting through donations. You can listen to his shows for free, so check them out. If you enjoy them as much as I do, you might even donate $1/?show to help him continue.</p>

Now, we’re just podcasting for fun, so we’re not concerned with getting a bunch of people to listen. But we’re still curious. Since the podcast files are hosted on Amazon’s S3, I started looking into ways of tracking downloads.</p>  <p>Let me save you some time: there’s no easy, accurate way to do it yourself.</p>  <figure>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-07-30-oldbookillustrations-rudder-fatum.jpg" alt="Tracking Amazon S3 downloads">  <figcaption>Me, calculating Amazon S3 downloads</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Thankfully, you don’t have to do it yourself: <a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">S3Stat</a> will do it for you! After a fifteen-minute setup, all I had to do was wait for the data to come in.</p>  <p>S3Stat collects the data and gives you some wonderful tables and graphs. You know I love graphs.</p>  <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2016-07-30-s3stat-graph.png" alt="Graph of Amazon S3 downloads"></p>  <p>For a hobby podcast like ours, I can’t justify paying $10/month for tracking download stats when we pay only pennies a month for website hosting and file storage. However, S3Stat has offered to give a free license to anyone who blogs about their product. Very generous!</p>  <p>To conclude: tracking S3 downloads yourself is ridiculously hard; S3Stat makes it ridiculously easy. For both businesses and hobby users using S3, their service is a no-brainer.</p>

A chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link: if you use the same password everywhere, then a hacker only has to break into one site (the least secure) and they now have access to your email, bank, and credit cards.</p>  <p>Using a password manager is much more secure. I use <a href="http://keepass.info/download.html">KeePass</a>. All of my passwords are stored in KeePass, which requires a master password to access. Now I just have to remember one password.

This works similarly to chromeIPass: you share the URL with KeePass2Android, which then pops up a notification which allows you to easily copy and paste the username and password into the website.</p>  <p>KeePass is a solid open-source project that is providing free security to tens of thousands of people. That’s why KeePass was my July creator donation, and KeePass2Android was my May creator donation.</p>

She was glad everything was going so beautifully. First, they’d had a princess tea party, complete with costumes, china cups and petit fours. Then they’d watched a movie playing off a bedsheet in the backyard, and shrieked in mock terror at the tires in the yard set to look like alligators (last month’s project). Now they were leaning out of the teepees she had arranged in their bedroom, gazing at the stars on the ceiling and discussing which boy they thought was cutest.</p>    <p>Yes, it had been a full and busy day, but much had been accomplished. The finishing touches had been added to the stairs, so that they now looked like book spines rather than just plain stairs. Her son’s room still needed some work done on it, but she had added the bookshelf decorated like a green pipe from the Mario-verse. Tomorrow she would start painting the tunnels through the Bowser’s Castle play area.</p>    <p>The last rays of the setting sun winked off the marbles she had set in the garden fence, and she smiled a good-night at the golf ball ladybugs she had placed to add some charm—</p>    <p>“It’s late. Let’s go to bed.” Her husband’s voice cut through her bliss, and with a sigh she headed toward the bedroom. As she trudged down the barren hallway in their apartment, she reflected on how quickly the evening had gone by. But she’d get through tomorrow’s chores of housework like she always did, and soon the evening would come and her child would go to sleep. Then she could again relax as she scoured Pinterest for tips and tricks, ideas and projects. And then off to bed again, to dream of all that she would never do.</p>

Books with an ISBN barcode can be scanned in; you can also type the ISBN code or title to enter books.

Back in college I snagged <a href="http://briankoser.com">briankoser.com</a>, put up some short programming articles, and experimented with HTML and CSS.</p>    <p>In 2015 I picked up <a href="http://koser.us">koser.us</a> as a place to put Melissa’s recipes and our Christmas Letters. I’ve slowly added more and will eventually move all of my online output here.</p>    <p>People assume it’s because I’m a software developer. If you make web sites for a living, you have to have your own website, right? Well, no. Most software developers, even web developers, don’t have their own site. In 2016, most people just use Facebook (along with Twitter, Medium, and some others).</p>    <p>I have a Facebook account myself. Why isn’t that good enough?</p>    <p>Here are all the reasons I have my own website.</p>    <h1 id="to-own-my-content">To own my content</h1>    <p><em>Hey Facebook, you can use my lawnmower whenever you want.</em></p>    <p>Posting on Facebook allows Facebook to use your words for free. Some people have handed Facebook multiple novels-worth of work. You still own the content, but Facebook can use it for whatever they want.</p>    <p>“Who cares if Facebook uses the status updates about my cat?” you say. I grant that this is more of a philosophical argument. But just because it’s philosophical doesn’t mean it’s not important. This point leads into:</p>    <h1 id="facebook-isn-t-free-as-in-free-beer-">Facebook isn’t free (as in “free beer”)</h1>    <p><em>Let me get you some free chips and salsa. I will also increase the cost of your entree by 10%.</em></p>    <p>One of the first principles of economics is: there’s no such thing as a free lunch. When you use a website, someone is paying for it. koser.us is paid for by me, to provide myself a platform. Facebook’s business model is:</p>    <ol>        <li>You give personal information to Facebook. Facebook gives you a place to find your friends and share your activities.</li>        <li>Facebook gives your personal information to advertisers. Advertisers give Facebook lots of money to run the website.</li>      <li>Advertisers target you with personalized ads based on your information.</li>    </ol>    <p>If you’re OK with this system, fine. I think there are people that wouldn’t be OK with that trade, but don’t realize they’re making it.</p>    <h1 id="facebook-isn-t-free-as-in-free-speech-">Facebook isn’t free (as in “free speech”)</h1>    <p>You cannot say whatever you want on Facebook or Twitter. As private companies, they have every right to delete your account if you say something they don’t like.</p>    <p>This is a good thing. Without any moderation, obnoxious users would drive others off the platform.</p>    <p>However, if you ever disagree with Facebook or Twitter’s standards on what speech is acceptable, you’re out of luck. This is one reason that social media sites are:</p>    <h1 id="facebook-is-an-unstable-platform">Facebook is an unstable platform</h1>    <p>Social media sites can delete your account at any time, without explanation. This has happened multiple times on Youtube and Twitter: a user promotes and builds their brand, gains followers, their account gets deleted.

Either way, people have lost <a href="https://marie-antoinettequeenoffrance.blogspot.com/2015/10/why-twitter-permanently-suspended-my.html">their followers</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/google-has-deleted-an-artist-s-blog-with-14-years-of-his-work">their content</a>, and even <a href="https://www.maxlaumeister.com/blog/google-is-deleting-your-favorite-youtube-videos/">their source of income</a>.</p>    <h1 id="for-an-easily-searchable-archive">For an easily-searchable archive</h1>    <p>Can you find that casserole recipe you posted on Facebook a few years ago?</p>    <h1 id="to-own-my-presentation">To own my presentation</h1>    <p>Websites like <a href="http://www.positivecomputing.org/2014/03/design-for-conflict-resolution-and.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9#.syb8bp65v">Medium</a> put a lot of thought into presentation.

If Twitter changes their Terms of Service to disallow your speech, will you leave? If you do you’ll probably be leaving all your content behind.</p>    <h1 id="for-a-wider-reach">For a wider reach</h1>    <p>There are over <strong>1 billion</strong> people on Facebook.

The irony of their impatience is that only by learning to wait, and by a willingness to accept the bad with the good, do we usually attain those things that are truly worthwhile.

He was a strong, able boy, but he did not enjoy going to school and he was forever daydreaming.</p>  <p>"Peter, what are you dreaming about this time?" his teacher would say to him.</p>  <p>"I’m thinking about what I’ll be when I grow up," Peter replied.</p>  <p>"Be patient. There’s plenty of time for that. Being grown up isn’t all fun, you know," his teacher said.</p>  <p>But Peter found it hard to enjoy whatever he was doing at the moment, and was always hankering after the next thing. In winter he longed for it to be summer again, and in summer he looked forward to the skating, sledging, and warm fires of winter. At school he would long for the day to be over so that he could go home, and on Sunday nights he would sigh, "If only the holidays would come." What he enjoyed most was playing with his friend Liese. She was as good a companion as any boy, and no matter how impatient Peter was, she never took offense. "When I grow up, I shall marry Liese," Peter said to himself.</p>  <p>Often he wandered through the forest, dreaming of the future. Sometimes he lay down on the soft forest floor in the warm sun, his hands behind his head, staring up at the sky through the distant treetops. One hot afternoon as he began to grow sleepy, he heard someone calling his name. He opened his eyes and sat up. Standing before him was an old woman. In her hand she held a silver ball, from which dangled a silken golden thread.</p>  <p>"See what I have got here, Peter," she said, offering the ball to him.</p>  <p>"What is it?" he asked curiously, touching the fine golden thread.</p>  <p>"This is your life thread," the old woman replied. "Do not touch it and time will pass normally. But if you wish time to pass more quickly, you have only to pull the thread a little way and an hour will pass like a second. But I warn you, once the thread has been pulled out, it cannot be pushed back in again. It will disappear like a puff of smoke. The ball is for you. But if you accept my gift you must tell no one, or on that very day you shall die. Now, say, do you want it?"</p>  <p>Peter seized the gift from her joyfully. It was just what he wanted. He examined the silver ball. It was light and solid, made of a single piece. The only flaw in it was the tiny hole from which the bright thread hung. He put the ball in his pocket and ran home. There, making sure that his mother was out, he examined it again. The thread seemed to be creeping very slowly out of the ball, so slowly that it was scarcely noticeable to the naked eye. He longed to give it a quick tug, but dared not do so. Not yet.</p>  <p>The following day at school, Peter sat daydreaming about what he would do with his magic thread. The teacher scolded him for not concentrating on his work. If only, he thought, it was time to go home. Then he felt the silver ball in his pocket. If he pulled out a tiny bit of thread, the day would be over. Very carefully he took hold of it and tugged. Suddenly the teacher was telling everyone to pack up their books and to leave the classroom in an orderly fashion. Peter was overjoyed. He ran all the way home. How easy life would be now! All his troubles were over. From that day forth he began to pull the thread, just a little, every day.</p>  <p>One day, however, it occurred to him that it was stupid to pull the thread just a little each day. If he gave it a harder tug, school would be over altogether. Then he could start learning a trade and marry Liese. So that night he gave the thread a hard tug, and in the morning he awoke to find himself apprenticed to a carpenter in town. He loved his new life, clambering about on roofs and scaffolding, lifting and hammering great beams into place that still smelled of the forest. But sometimes, when payday seemed too far off, he gave the thread a little tug and suddenly the week was drawing to a close and it was Friday night and he had money in his pocket.</p>  <p>Liese had also come to town and was living with her aunt, who taught her housekeeping. Peter began to grow impatient for the day when they would be married. It was hard to live so near and yet so far from her. He asked her when they could be married.</p>  <p>"In another year," she said. "Then I will have learned how to be a capable wife."</p>  <p>Peter fingered the silver ball in his pocket.</p>  <p>"Well, the time will pass quickly enough," he said, knowingly.</p>  <p>That night Peter could not sleep. He tossed and turned restlessly. He took the magic ball from under his pillow. For a moment he hesitated; then his impatience got the better of him, and he tugged at the golden thread. In the morning he awoke to find that the year was over and that Liese had at last agreed to marry him. Now Peter felt truly happy.</p>  <p>But before their wedding could take place, Peter received an official-looking letter. He opened it in trepidation and read that he was expected to report at the army barracks the following week for two years’ military service. He showed the letter to Liese in despair.</p>  <p>"Well," she said, "there is nothing for it, we shall just have to wait. But the time will pass quickly, you’ll see. There are so many things to do in preparation for our life together."</p>  <p>Peter smiled bravely, knowing that two years would seem a lifetime to him.</p>  <p>Once Peter had settled into life at the barracks, however, he began to feel that it wasn’t so bad after all. He quite enjoyed being with all the other young men, and their duties were not very arduous at first. He remembered the old woman’s warning to use the thread wisely and for a while refrained from pulling it. But in time he grew restless again. Army life bored him with its routine duties and harsh discipline. He began pulling the thread to make the week go faster so that it would be Sunday again, or to speed up the time until he was due for leave. And so the two years passed almost as if they had been a dream.</p>  <p>Back home, Peter determined not to pull the thread again until it was absolutely necessary. After all, this was the best time of his life, as everyone told him. He did not want it to be over too quickly. He did, however, give the thread one or two very small tugs, just to speed along the day of his marriage. He longed to tell Liese his secret, but he knew that if he did he would die.</p>  <p>On the day of his wedding, everyone, including Peter, was happy. He could hardly wait to show Liese the house he had built for her. At the wedding feast he glanced over at his mother. He noticed for the first time how gray her hair had grown recently. She seemed to be aging so quickly. Peter felt a pang of guilt that he had pulled the thread so often. Henceforward he would be much more sparing with it and only use it when it was strictly necessary.</p>  <p>A few months later Liese announced that she was going to have a child. Peter was overjoyed and could hardly wait. When the child was born, he felt that he could never want for anything again. But whenever the child was ill or cried through the sleepless night, he gave the thread a little tug, just so that the baby might be well and happy again.</p>  <p>Times were hard. Business was bad and a government had come to power that squeezed the people dry with taxes and would tolerate no opposition. Anyone who became known as a troublemaker was thrown into prison without trial and rumor was enough to condemn a man. Peter had always been known as one who spoke his mind, and very soon he was arrested and cast into jail. Luckily he had his magic ball with him and he tugged very hard at the thread. The prison walls dissolved before him and his enemies were scattered in the huge explosion that burst forth like thunder. It was the war that had been threatening, but it was over as quickly as a summer storm, leaving behind it an exhausted peace. Peter found himself back home with his family. But now he was a middle-aged man.</p>  <p>For a time things went well and Peter lived in relative contentment. One day he looked at his magic ball and saw to his surprise that the thread had turned from gold to silver. He looked in the mirror. His hair was starting to turn gray and his face was lined where before there had not been a wrinkle to be seen. He suddenly felt afraid and determined to use the thread even more carefully than before. Liese bore him more children and he seemed happy as the head of his growing household. His stately manner often made people think of him as some sort of benevolent ruler. He had an air of authority as if he held the fate of others in his hands. He kept his magic ball in a well-hidden place, safe from the curious eyes of his children, knowing that if anyone were to discover it, it would be fatal.</p>  <p>As the number of his children grew, so his house became more overcrowded. He would have to extend it, but for that he needed money. He had other worries too. His mother was looking older and more tired every day. It was of no use to pull the magic thread because that would only hasten her approaching death. All too soon she died, and as Peter stood at her graveside, he wondered how it was that life passed so quickly, even without pulling the magic thread.</p>  <p>One night as he lay in bed, kept awake by his worries, he thought how much easier life would be if all his children were grown up and launched upon their careers in life. He gave the thread a mighty tug, and the following day he awoke to find that his children had all left home for jobs in different parts of the country, and that he and his wife were alone. His hair was almost white now and often his back and limbs ached as he climbed the ladder or lifted a heavy beam into place. Liese too was getting old and she was often ill. He couldn’t bear to see her suffer, so that more and more he resorted to pulling at the magic thread. But as soon as one trouble was solved, another seemed to grow in its place. Perhaps life would be easier if he retired, Peter thought. Then he would no longer have to clamber about on drafty, half-completed buildings and he could look after Liese when she was ill. The trouble was that he didn’t have enough money to live on. He picked up his magic ball and looked at it. To his dismay he saw that the thread was no longer silver but gray and lusterless. He decided to go for a walk in the forest to think things over.</p>  <p>It was a long time since he had been in that part of the forest. The small saplings had all grown into tall fir trees, and it was hard to find the path he had once known. Eventually he came to a bench in a clearing. He sat down to rest and fell into a light doze. He was woken by someone calling his name, "Peter! Peter!"</p>  <p>He looked up and saw the old woman he had met so many years ago when she had given him the magic silver ball with its golden thread. She looked just as she had on that day, not a day older. She smiled at him.</p>  <p>"So, Peter, have you had a good life?" she asked.</p>  <p>"I’m not sure," Peter said. "Your magic ball is a wonderful thing. I have never had to suffer or wait for anything in my life. And yet it has all passed so quickly. I feel that I have had no time to take in what has happened to me, neither the good things nor the bad. Now there is so little time left. I dare not pull the thread again for it will only bring me to my death. I do not think your gift has brought me luck."</p>  <p>"How ungrateful you are!" the old woman said. "In what way would you have wished things to be different?"</p>  <p>"Perhaps if you had given me a different ball, one where I could have pushed the thread back in as well as pulling it out. Then I could have relived the things that went badly."</p>  <p>The old woman laughed. "You ask a great deal! Do you think that God allows us to live our lives twice over? But I can grant you one final wish, you foolish, demanding man."</p>  <p>"What is that?" Peter asked.</p>  <p>"Choose," the old woman said. Peter thought hard.</p>  <p>At length he said, "I should like to live my life again as if for the first time, but without your magic ball. Then I will experience the bad things as well as the good without cutting them short, and at least my life will not pass as swiftly and meaninglessly as a daydream."</p>  <p>"So be it," said the old woman. "Give me back my ball."</p>  <p>She stretched out her hand and Peter placed the silver ball in it. Then he sat back and closed his eyes with exhaustion.</p>  <p>When he awoke he was in his own bed. His youthful mother was bending over him, shaking him gently.</p>  <p>"Wake up, Peter. You will be late for school. You were sleeping like the dead!"</p>  <p>He looked up at her in surprise and relief.</p>  <p>"I’ve had a terrible dream, Mother. I dreamed that I was old and sick and that my life had passed like the blinking of an eye with nothing to show for it. Not even any memories."</p>  <p>His mother laughed and shook her head.</p>  <p>"That will never happen," she said. "Memories are the one thing we all have, even when we are old. Now hurry and get dressed. Liese is waiting for you and you will be late for school."</p>  <p>As Peter walked to school with Liese, he noticed what a bright summer morning it was, the kind of morning when it felt good to be alive. Soon he would see his friends and classmates, and even the prospect of lessons didn’t seem so bad. In fact he could hardly wait.</p>   <div class="hr-container">      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 360 40" class="hr-image">          <circle cx="20"  cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="100" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="180" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="260" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />          <circle cx="340" cy="20" r="20" style="fill:#000000" />      </svg>      <hr class="visuallyhidden">  </div>   <p>Written by Anonymous</p>    <p>Excerpted from <i class="work-title">The Book of Virtues</i>.</p>

We also took a day trip to New Orleans with Micah Bucy, where we tried some local food, got some beignets, and listened to a local jazz band on the street. We also checked out a costume shop. It was interesting to see all the creative ways people were making money, from juggling and magic tricks, to music performances, to being a living statue.

The best part of the trip was that it took him close enough to visit family.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-grandpa.jpg" alt="Brian with Grandpa Koser">      <figcaption>Holy cat!</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>We got to see a lot of family this year.

It has certainly helped us get to know each other better, bringing out things we’re either very united or very divided on. One of our proudest moments was hyping Oreo O’s in our <a href="http://tto.koser.us/episodes/046-breakfast-cereals/">cereal episode</a> and then learning less than a week later that it was returning to stores!</p>  <p>In May we got to use one of Melissa’s Christmas gifts and see Celtic Woman in concert! While we enjoyed every minute of it, our favorite parts were when they sang old favorites such as “Orinoco Flow”.</p>  <p>We’ve stayed busy with different church activities, some of the more memorable being the Mother/?Daughter Luau and a dessert auction. Melissa enjoyed making crab appetizers for the former, and a gorgeous cake for the latter. We also got to participate in our yearly Neighborhood Bible Time, this year helping teach the preschool class. It was both precious and interesting; you just never know what those kids will say or do at any given time.</p>  <p>Another couple big events were Brian’s siblings weddings. Congratulations Matt and Amanda, and Josh and Megan!</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-matts-wedding.jpg" alt="Brian, Melissa, and Lydia with Matt and Amanda">  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-megans-wedding.jpg" alt="Brian and Melissa with Josh and Megan">  </figure>  <p>Melissa’s brother Tim finished his service with the Navy, staying with us for a few months while also driving across the country to visit family and friends. While he visited we took our summer vacation in Orlando with friends Micah and the Smiths. It was a fun week filled with a Pirate Dinner Adventure, a trip to Disney Springs, a spur-of-the-moment movie theater trip, and lots and lots of games. </p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-orlando.jpg" alt="Brian, Melissa, and Lydia with the pirate captain">      <figcaption>Arrr!</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>A couple weeks after vacation we moved to a house in preparation for baby #2. The move went smoothly with help from our church friends, and we are now located a 10-minute walk away from Brian’s workplace. We took the opportunity of a fresh start to split our two bookshelves into his and hers, drafting all our books to determine where they’d be stored. Nerdy, but it’s how we get our thrills.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-book-draft.jpg" alt="Our books piled on the floor">      <figcaption>Books stacked by author and genre</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>A few other highlights of the year were our birthday celebrations. For Brian’s, we got a babysitter, ate at a fancy restaurant overlooking the city, and stayed overnight at a local bed and breakfast. The next day we toured downtown Mobile, then headed back to the apartment for a surprise birthday party! For Melissa’s, we ate escargot (first time) and schnitzel at a local European restaurant. For Lydia’s, we had friends over for a Sesame Street party.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-sesame-street-birthday.jpg" alt="Sesame Street-themed snacks">  </figure>  <p>In October, Hurricane Nate cleared the way to the hospital so we could welcome our new addition, Amber London Koser! We were blessed to have Tim, Mom and Dad Binzel, and Mom Koser helping us the first few days after she was born.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2017-12-25-christmas-letter-lydia-and-amber.jpg" alt="Lydia and Amber on the bed">  </figure>  <p>Two weeks later, our church held its annual pie and cake competition. Melissa was still recovering from childbirth, but at Brian’s encouragement she sent a blueberry cream pie with him and entered it in the competition. It won! This is her second year in a row winning first place in the pie division.</p>  <p>Hope your 2017 was as memorable as ours, and we hope to see many of you in 2018!</p>

It’s been a great year in the Koser house, full of activities that have brought us closer together as a family.</p>  <p>Three birthday parties were among the highlights of the year. In February, we hosted a murder mystery escape room for Melissa’s brother Tim’s birthday. Melissa set up the escape room and enjoyed watching everyone try to solve her riddles and clues.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-escape-room.jpg" alt="Murder Mystery Escape Room characters">      <figcaption>The Murder Mystery suspects</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Brian’s birthday in April featured a root beer tasting party! We certainly hadn’t realized there are so many distinct kinds of root beer.</p>  <p>Melissa got a surprise birthday party in August where we played The Last Banquet, a game for up to 25 that we’ve been trying to play for years.</p>  <p>Maybe our most memorable outing was to the National Shrimp Festival. Brian and Melissa went for the food (fresh shrimp, crab cakes, Brian’s first taste of shark, and fried Oreos), while Lydia really enjoyed getting her face painted for the first time!</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-rainbow-kitty.jpg" alt="Lydia with her Rainbow Kitty face paint">      <figcaption>Rainbow Kitty!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Some other unique experiences from 2018 were petting a kangaroo at the Gulf Coast Zoo, attending a deluxe movie theater (complete with recliners and waiters who bring you fancy food!), and visiting New Orleans with Brian’s sister Megan and her husband Josh to check out the Audubon Aquarium.</p>  <p>By far some of our best memories came from our summer travels. In late May, we went on our Midwest Road Trip: 14 states, 12 stops, and lots of friends and family crammed into two weeks. The girls handled all of that driving like champs. You can hear all about the trip <a href="http://tto.koser.us/episodes/079-midwest-road-trip-2018/">on our podcast</a>.</p>  <p>One week after we returned home, Melissa was able to fly out to Colorado with baby Amber and surprise her sister Melody.</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-union-station.jpg" alt="Union Station, Kansas City, Missouri">      <figcaption>Union Station in Kansas City</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>September saw us check an item off our bucket list: we attended a standup special featuring Brian Regan, our favorite comedian! That night may have been the hardest we laughed all year.</p>  <p>The last big event we attended was our first NFL game in November. We met up with Brian’s family in New Orleans and watched the Eagles play the Saints. Since half of the family are Eagles fans and half are Saints fans, only half left the game happy. :)</p>  <figure>      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.koser.us/img/journal/2019-01-01-christmas-letter-eagles-game.jpg" alt="Kosers and Tim at the Eagles-Saints game">      <figcaption>Fly Eagles Fly!</figcaption>    </figure>  <p>Brian also made it to his first NBA game with Tim to see Tim’s Miami Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans. Tim also finished the year with us, spending the Christmas week playing board games and introducing Brian to some Binzel-favorite Christmas movies.</p>  <p>Amber started walking and knows what cows, pigs, and sheep say.</p>  <p>Lydia was finally potty trained this past February! It has been so nice to only have one diaper to change in this house. She also started doing some preschool classes at a homeschool co-op hosted at our church. At the end of the year she sang her first church special with Melissa.</p>  <figure>      <div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/309018670" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>      <figcaption>Melissa and Lydia singing “God’s Been Good”</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Melissa accomplished several home projects, including a busyboard for Amber, an apron for Lydia, a dice tray for Brian, and a framed board game for them all.</p>  <p>Brian started being more health-conscious and lost 20 pounds. At work he got a promotion and started a ping pong league. And his major project was <a href="http://sfc.blue">sfc.blue</a>, a listener’s guide for our favorite podcast, The Sci-Fi Christian.</p>  <p>It was a great year, and we’re very excited about all that 2019 has in store for us.

We've hit 3 of the four corners of the U.S. (and much in between), taken a cruise to Haiti and Jamaica, and flown to Honduras. We travel because we have family and friends widely spread around, or because we're looking for new job opportunities, or because we like to experience new adventures. But mostly we travel because we itch to. After months, or weeks, or perhaps mere days of the same routine, we desire something fresh to tantalize us. We may travel to see that movie we've been anticipating, or finally get over to a local friend's house that we've never visited during our many years of residence, or even just check out a new store whose sole novelty is its newness. Why? Because there's something so delightful about the unknown, so thrilling about being in a new environment with new sights, sounds, smells, and sensations. Even places we've previously been to can be exciting, if they're not well-known or haven't been visited in some time: a house you've just moved into (but haven't yet unpacked), a store whose merchandise changes with the seasons, a different street explored on your daily walk. Bored with your life? You needn't leave town to experience change. Simply...travel.</p>

The three selected franchises will hire part-time atheist employees to work one day a week, allowing the famously Christian organization to remain open on Sundays.</p><p>"This initiative will allow us to serve all members of our community every day of the week, and still retain our convictions to honor the Lord's Day," said Cathy Belmont, Chik-fil-A public relations spokesman. "These workers of no faith will allow us to honor our faith."</p><p>Local evangelical pastors have been quick to criticize the move. "I just completed a seven-week sermon series on 'Keeping the Sabbath'", said Reverend Lincoln Hereford. "We had finally committed as a church to only eat canned foods on Sunday, but all of that progress has been erased by Chik-fil-A. How am I supposed to keep the flock away from crispy chicken sandwiches after the morning service?" Reverend Hereford declined to comment when asked if he would be protesting the change with a boycott.</p><p>Chik-fil-A sees no conflict. "The reality is that Christians like to go out for Sunday afternoon lunch," said Cathy Belmont. "Would it be better for them to purchase the burgers of this world, or to worship God together over a plate of waffle fries?"</p><p>Local Chik-fil-A management is also in favor of the move. "I will of course be on call every Sunday," said Angus Kerry, manager at the Airport Boulevard franchise. "It will be a spiritual hardship, but Chik-fil-A has worked with my schedule and remuneration to ensure that I can shoulder the burden."</p><p>The manager does not foresee any conflict between the current and incoming employees. "With cross-training and schedule substitutions, it's inevitable that there will be some mixing of the employees," said Mr. Kerry. "But all our full-time employees will go through sensitivity training to learn how to interact with the new employees. And we will strongly discourage proselytizing on the job to reduce turnover in the non-faith-practicing portion of our staff."</p><p>Chik-fil-A has also faced renewed criticism from synagogues and Seventh-Day Adventist churches. "We've held a few rallies to demand that Chik-fil-A close on Saturday," said Pastor Bill Miller of Gilmore Creek Seventh-day Adventist Church of Mobile. "So this is definitely a setback. But I'm taking it as a sign to redouble our efforts."</p><p>Other Christians see no problem with working on Sundays. Local pastor Moses Jones explained, "Well, the Sabbath was actually on Saturday, and it only applied to the Jews. There's no reason a Christian couldn't worship God and work on Sundays."</p><p>Cathy Belmont cautions critics that this is only a pilot program and will not necessarily be continued throughout the country. "We'll look at the numbers after the trial, and who knows? Maybe we'll draw some customers that would never darken the door of a church. To me, that would be a success."</p><hr><p>I got the idea for this article back when <a href="https://babylonbee.com/">Babylon Bee</a> took submissions.

Unmoved, the great beast roared back its own defiance and swung its mighty tail at the knight, who nimbly rolled under it even as he swung at it with his blade. A great gout of blood gushed forth from the severed stump, and the enraged dragon snarled in pain. As the warrior sprang to his feet, a lash of claws sent him flying backwards, tunic rent and blood spraying. The dragon howled in triumph, while the princess it grasped in its fearsome talons screamed in despair. It lumbered over towards the fallen man and prepared to deliver the death blow. But as its teeth came crashing down, the knight thrust upward with his sword straight into the dragon’s maw. The beast was vanquished, the damsel was saved, and great glory was won!</i></p><p>Shadows fell as the sun went down, and the man wearily stumped through his land, shutting the gates, checking the locks, restocking the defenses. It had been years since any attacks had come, yet every night he methodically went through the routine. Each night it took a little longer, each night it drained more energy; he was getting old. Sometimes, in his deepest fears which he tried to dismiss, he wondered if he would be able to repel an attack should it ever come. As he entered his dwelling, the simple closing of the door became more of a collapsing against it from weariness. He closed his eyes a moment in despondency. Where was the strength of his youth? What of the courage that once had burned so fiercely within him? No more did acts of valor define him, no more did great renown surround him; the foes he fought of late were aching joints and halting movements. He trudged through the halls, thoughts heavy with gloom. An open doorway caught his eye, and he paused to glance inside. Peace and contentment flowed from this room, where slept an ethereal queen and a young boy. The lady’s fair beauty stirred him as always, more lovely now than the day of their wedding. Their son curled trustingly in her arms, doubtless dreaming of grand adventures to come. A smile creased the man’s face as he thought on how the lad watched him, clung to his tales, and mimicked them later with his toys. He gazed once more at his beloved family, who wholly trusted and believed in him.</p><p>The warrior gently closed the door and moved to his own chamber, setting the lamp down beside his bed. Gone were the years, gone the creases, gone the faltering steps. As he climbed into bed, the shadow cast by the lamplight was that of a tall figure, cloak streaming out and blade held high aloft.</p>

"I'm tired of this!" he complained. His mother smiled tenderly as she answered, "It won't be long now; these things usually clear up in a day or two." Sure enough, just a few days later the sun was shining brightly again, and the little boy was happy. But some time later, dark clouds began to boil overhead, and gusts of wind lashed fiercely at the car. Full of fear, the little boy whimpered, "How much longer is this going to last?" His older sister leaned over from her seat and hugged him. "It's OK," she reassured him."Sometimes you just have to let things run their course. It'll pass eventually." And just as she had promised, the frightful weather was replaced with peace and calm. But again, as time went on... "Please, make it stop!" screamed the little boy, as lightning flashed and thunder crashed. Hail pummeled the car, and night made it impossible to see anything outside. His father gently stroked the little boy's head, and gathered him in his arms. Calmly, the father spoke of their journey together. "We're in here for the foreseeable future, son, and only God knows how long this will take. But He's the One we're relying on to get us through, and He won't fail us." The little boy remained quiet all that evening and all through the next, content to rest in his father's loving embrace. Just before dawn, the car rolled to a gentle stop, and the little boy got out. As he lay down on a grassy mound, a beatific smile blossomed on his face. "Look, Daddy," he said, closing his eyes, "I can see the Sun."</p><p>The little car rolled on, carrying three hearts which grieved (and yet were lighter) toward a glorious sunrise.</p>
