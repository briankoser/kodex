The three selected franchises will hire part-time atheist employees to work one day a week, allowing the famously Christian organization to remain open on Sundays.</p><p>"This initiative will allow us to serve all members of our community every day of the week, and still retain our convictions to honor the Lord's Day," said Cathy Belmont, Chik-fil-A public relations spokesman. "These workers of no faith will allow us to honor our faith."</p><p>Local evangelical pastors have been quick to criticize the move. "I just completed a seven-week sermon series on 'Keeping the Sabbath'", said Reverend Lincoln Hereford. "We had finally committed as a church to only eat canned foods on Sunday, but all of that progress has been erased by Chik-fil-A. How am I supposed to keep the flock away from crispy chicken sandwiches after the morning service?" Reverend Hereford declined to comment when asked if he would be protesting the change with a boycott.</p><p>Chik-fil-A sees no conflict. "The reality is that Christians like to go out for Sunday afternoon lunch," said Cathy Belmont. "Would it be better for them to purchase the burgers of this world, or to worship God together over a plate of waffle fries?"</p><p>Local Chik-fil-A management is also in favor of the move. "I will of course be on call every Sunday," said Angus Kerry, manager at the Airport Boulevard franchise. "It will be a spiritual hardship, but Chik-fil-A has worked with my schedule and remuneration to ensure that I can shoulder the burden."</p><p>The manager does not foresee any conflict between the current and incoming employees. "With cross-training and schedule substitutions, it's inevitable that there will be some mixing of the employees," said Mr. Kerry. "But all our full-time employees will go through sensitivity training to learn how to interact with the new employees. And we will strongly discourage proselytizing on the job to reduce turnover in the non-faith-practicing portion of our staff."</p><p>Chik-fil-A has also faced renewed criticism from synagogues and Seventh-Day Adventist churches. "We've held a few rallies to demand that Chik-fil-A close on Saturday," said Pastor Bill Miller of Gilmore Creek Seventh-day Adventist Church of Mobile. "So this is definitely a setback. But I'm taking it as a sign to redouble our efforts."</p><p>Other Christians see no problem with working on Sundays. Local pastor Moses Jones explained, "Well, the Sabbath was actually on Saturday, and it only applied to the Jews. There's no reason a Christian couldn't worship God and work on Sundays."</p><p>Cathy Belmont cautions critics that this is only a pilot program and will not necessarily be continued throughout the country. "We'll look at the numbers after the trial, and who knows? Maybe we'll draw some customers that would never darken the door of a church. To me, that would be a success."</p><hr><p>I got the idea for this article back when <a href="https://babylonbee.com/">Babylon Bee</a> took submissions. Unfortunately, they now only publish articles written by their paid contributors.</p>

"Tired of watching what I eat, and watching my husband eat what I can't have but so desperately desire. Maybe we should be done with children after this one."</p><p>"That was awful!" I groaned after going through yet another Pitocin-heavy labor, and enduring lonely hours during recovery in the hospital while hooked up to machines. "I don't know that I want to go through it ever again."</p><p>"I'm done with this!" I cried as I dealt with breastfeeding issues all over again, all while sleep-deprived and hormonally unstable. "We're not having any more children!"</p><p>"Maybe just one more child," I thought as I snuggled my baby's soft head against my cheek, and gazed down at her tiny, trusting face.</p>

Unmoved, the great beast roared back its own defiance and swung its mighty tail at the knight, who nimbly rolled under it even as he swung at it with his blade. A great gout of blood gushed forth from the severed stump, and the enraged dragon snarled in pain. As the warrior sprang to his feet, a lash of claws sent him flying backwards, tunic rent and blood spraying. The dragon howled in triumph, while the princess it grasped in its fearsome talons screamed in despair. It lumbered over towards the fallen man and prepared to deliver the death blow. But as its teeth came crashing down, the knight thrust upward with his sword straight into the dragon’s maw. The beast was vanquished, the damsel was saved, and great glory was won!</i></p><p>Shadows fell as the sun went down, and the man wearily stumped through his land, shutting the gates, checking the locks, restocking the defenses. It had been years since any attacks had come, yet every night he methodically went through the routine. Each night it took a little longer, each night it drained more energy; he was getting old. Sometimes, in his deepest fears which he tried to dismiss, he wondered if he would be able to repel an attack should it ever come. As he entered his dwelling, the simple closing of the door became more of a collapsing against it from weariness. He closed his eyes a moment in despondency. Where was the strength of his youth? What of the courage that once had burned so fiercely within him? No more did acts of valor define him, no more did great renown surround him; the foes he fought of late were aching joints and halting movements. He trudged through the halls, thoughts heavy with gloom. An open doorway caught his eye, and he paused to glance inside. Peace and contentment flowed from this room, where slept an ethereal queen and a young boy. The lady’s fair beauty stirred him as always, more lovely now than the day of their wedding. Their son curled trustingly in her arms, doubtless dreaming of grand adventures to come. A smile creased the man’s face as he thought on how the lad watched him, clung to his tales, and mimicked them later with his toys. He gazed once more at his beloved family, who wholly trusted and believed in him.</p><p>The warrior gently closed the door and moved to his own chamber, setting the lamp down beside his bed. Gone were the years, gone the creases, gone the faltering steps. As he climbed into bed, the shadow cast by the lamplight was that of a tall figure, cloak streaming out and blade held high aloft.</p>

"I'm tired of this!" he complained. His mother smiled tenderly as she answered, "It won't be long now; these things usually clear up in a day or two." Sure enough, just a few days later the sun was shining brightly again, and the little boy was happy. But some time later, dark clouds began to boil overhead, and gusts of wind lashed fiercely at the car. Full of fear, the little boy whimpered, "How much longer is this going to last?" His older sister leaned over from her seat and hugged him. "It's OK," she reassured him."Sometimes you just have to let things run their course. It'll pass eventually." And just as she had promised, the frightful weather was replaced with peace and calm. But again, as time went on... "Please, make it stop!" screamed the little boy, as lightning flashed and thunder crashed. Hail pummeled the car, and night made it impossible to see anything outside. His father gently stroked the little boy's head, and gathered him in his arms. Calmly, the father spoke of their journey together. "We're in here for the foreseeable future, son, and only God knows how long this will take. But He's the One we're relying on to get us through, and He won't fail us." The little boy remained quiet all that evening and all through the next, content to rest in his father's loving embrace. Just before dawn, the car rolled to a gentle stop, and the little boy got out. As he lay down on a grassy mound, a beatific smile blossomed on his face. "Look, Daddy," he said, closing his eyes, "I can see the Sun."</p><p>The little car rolled on, carrying three hearts which grieved (and yet were lighter) toward a glorious sunrise.</p>
