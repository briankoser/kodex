Lydia's version of [Hush Little Baby](https://genius.com/Baby-lullabies-hush-little-baby-lyrics):

<p><pre>Hush my little baby
Don’t you cry
Daddy’s going to buy you a popping sleigh
If that popping sleigh pops away, 
Daddy’s going to buy you a goat with hay
If that goat eats all that hay,
Daddy’s going to buy you a diamond ring. 
If that diamond ring breaks to brass
Daddy’s going to buy you a cup of clear glass. 
If that cup breaks again
Daddy’s going to buy you a baby hen. 
If that hen had some chicks
Daddy will buy you a clock that ticks. 
If that clock doesn’t wake you up
Daddy’s going to buy you a rabbit skin. 
There is nothing wrong about that
So we’ll eat it up. Daddy’s going to buy you a hat.</pre></p>
