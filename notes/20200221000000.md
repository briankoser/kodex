It was 8:30 at night, and Brian and I hadn't eaten. I had wanted to make burgers, but it just kept getting later and later as we tried to get the kids into bed at a decent hour. Finally they were down, but since it was so late I considered just scrounging. Brian, self-sacrificing that he is, said that would be fine with him. I felt dissatisfied with how the night was turning out, and after a minute of internal debate declared I was going to make the burgers anyway. He looked so pleased, I knew Iâ€™d made the right decision.
