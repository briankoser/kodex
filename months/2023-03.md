      - "Beauty delights. It is objective: it rests in the object."
      - There is also a subjective aspect to beauty, call it enjoyable beauty, that is related to taste.
      - A well-cooked meal is objectively good. You may subjectively prefer steak or seafood.

    notes:
      - St. Ambrose's doctrine of justification is more like Luther's sola fide than Trent
      - St. Thomas's doctrine of predestination agrees with the Synod of Dordt
      - Council of Nicea assumed Alexandria was on par with Rome.
      - Conversion to RCC would be rooted in private judgment.
      - Infighting proves that RCC teaching is not clear. Magisterium multiplies the number of texts you must read.
      - The reformers were catholics who also appealed to scripture and tradition.
  - author: Gavin Ortlund
    notes:
      - Luther considered RCC baptism valid.
      - Calvin denied that RCC was *the* church, but not that RC churches are churches.
      - Even when Luther called the pope 'antichrist', he said he was within the church. He wanted unity, but Rome wouldn't talk to him.
      - Reformers pointed to the EO church as proof the church could exist without the pope.
      - Protestant view is not that you shouldn't confess to other people, it's that you don't need to go to a priest for forgiveness, and mortal sin won't send you to hell.
      - Protestant position is not that personal judgment is unlimited. Denominations and churches have statements of faith.
      - "The *Shepherd of Hermas* refers to presbyters over the church in Rome: there is no unbroken line of popes."
  - author: Brad Littlejohn
    notes: 
      - Protestants convert to RCC because of authority hunger, holiness deficit disorder, and a desire to be in the inner ring.

    notes:
      - Ruger American 308 is a good starter hunting rifle. It can take down any North American game.

      - Boycotts may not hurt big businesses, but they can benefit small businesses. Buy local instead of Amazon.

    notes:
      - Protestants convert to RCC in a quest for certainty. Modernity makes everything a choice.
      - Kevin Vanhoozer calls the Bible the "norm of Christian wisdom" with creeds, councils, tradition (aka catholicity) testifying to its meaning.
      - "Ditch Theory of Church History: Constantine put the church in a ditch and my denomination got us out"
      - Sacraments, priesthood, papacy, Mariology are more Roman than catholic.
      - To be deep in history, go to the church of history, then beyond to Jerusalem, Haran, Ararat, Eden.
      - Liturgy is tangible grace. Vermigli agreed with Augustine that "the sacramental symbols are visible words".
      - Protestants emphasize words, sometimes at the expense of the physical. We must have both.
    - The church for 1000 years gave the the cup to all except infants and the sick. Then the RCC withheld the cup from laity to avoid spills and because "laity can receive the whole Christ through the bread". Vatican II encouraged fullness instead of minimums.
