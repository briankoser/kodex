personal:
  - Fourth daughter was born! Susanna Carol Koser, named for her grandmothers.
projects:
  - Started a project related to Lancelot Andrewes's daily prayers. Step one is to get a transcript.
  - Started learning to juggle. Best to date is 3 balls for 10 seconds.
notes:
  - Experts have narrow knowledge. Generalists have broad knowledge. Leaders should be generalists. (Haywood)
  - Modern man is too abstract, always imagining what they look like on camera. (Jason Farley)
  - Be incarnational (Swait)
  - Cain spilled Abel's blood on the ground. The blood called to God from the ground. Cain's punishment is banishment from the ground.
  - "Hidden education assumptions: must meet 5 days a week, must separate by age, teach to the middle, different teachers and rooms for different subjects (Rusty Olps, Digressio podcast #7)"
  - The best things in life are useless. (Karl Schudt, Online Great Books Podcast #49)
  - Western music is tension, then release--starting from a note, moving away, then returning to the starting note. Comedy is tension and release--setup and punchline. (Karl Schudt and Jimmy Carr, different times and places but serendipitously heard by me the same week.)
  - Shakespeare's only original play was his last, The Tempest. Originality in story telling is a modern preoccupation. (Literary Life Podcast, Intro to Shakespeare and Midsummer Night's Dream)
  - Tragedy arc is shaped like a frown (∩); comedy arc is shaped like a smile (∪). (Ibid)
  - Wodehouse wrote Roman comedies. (Ibid)
  - "Pagan literature was mostly tragic. Christian literature, comic. Deep comedy is when the end is better than the beginning. History is a deep comedy: from the Garden to the City. (Ibid)"
  - Spenser was the first to synthesize Greek myth and fairy tales (Shakespeare and Lewis followed). (Ibid)
  - "Original biggest days of the Christian calendar: Christmas (winter solstice) and the Feast of St. John the Baptist (summer solstice). (Northrop Frye, Ibid)"
  - Puns are the comedy of words; irony is the tragedy of words. (Harold Goddard, Ibid)
  - "Fairy tales start with: (1) Bride and bridegroom are separated, reunited at the end (2) Parent and child are separated, reunited at the end"
  - Comedy ends in a wedding, feast, or dance. (Ibid)
  - Circumcized Israelites were in the covenant, but still needed to believe by faith. Baptized Christians are in the covenant, but still need to believe by faith?
quotes:
  - author: Johannes Kepler
    text: I was merely thinking God's thoughts after him.

I'm giving bullet journaling another try. After one month, I think it's going to stick. I don't miss the digital benefits like I did 10 or so years ago.

I'm also going to try sharing highlights for each month here.
