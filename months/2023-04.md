    notes: 
      - "OT purity laws (not mixing fabrics, not boiling kids in mother's milk) mirror the Genesis 1 separation of light and dark, earth and sky, dry land and sea. Cosmic order comes from boundaries; chaos is when everything mixes. Christianity modifies this: we are one in Christ. The traditional communion covering cloth is made of mixed fabrics. Jews didn't eat unclean animals (clean is cloven hoof - proper separation - and chews cud - proper integration of reality). But after Peter's vision, Christians eat all animals. The unclean is transformed to clean. Syncretism is transforming a culture to clean."

    notes: 
      - Baptist ministers in colonial Virginia were flogged for being Baptist. Saying the government shouldn't have done that is to agree that government should conform to Christianity. If you say Baptists can't declare the word of God to magistrates, you should stop being Baptist. "Saving children from slaughter, mutilation, and slavery should be more important to you than 'not baptizing them.'"

    notes:
      - "Ordinance originally meant the activities ordained by Christ: baptism, communion, preaching, prayer. Was not an alternative to sacraments."

I decided not to continue writing code to import Goodreads reviews to this site. The Goodreads API is terrible, deprecated, maybe will be shutdown at some point. The cost-benefit ratio is too high.

Bought my first Mac computer. Other than the adjustments with window management and keyboard shortcuts, it's been a good change.
