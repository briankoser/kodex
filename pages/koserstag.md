Known to some as St. Kosers' Day, Koserstag is a holiday rich with meaning and tradition.

## Quick Facts

Koserstag is always oberved on the first Saturday of June. Unless another event (like a wedding) conflicts, in which case it is always observed on the fourth Saturday of July.

## All Kosers' Eve

The day before Koserstag is known as All Kosers' Eve. Traditionally, we call family members (Kosers and honorary Kosers), eat pizza, watch a movie, and camp out in the living room. (Well, mom and dad sleep in bed. The girls camp out.)

## Koserstag Traditions
