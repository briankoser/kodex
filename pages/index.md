Hi, I'm Brian. This is where I, Melissa, Lydia, Amber, Penny, and Suzy keep our digital stuff. I'm slowly re-working this website into my image.

See most of our writing on the [articles page](/articles). I've also recently written a [Butlerian Handbook](/butlerian-handbook).

The podcast is still at the [Ten to One site](https://tto.koser.us), but you can also see new episodes pop up on the [podcasts page](/podcasts).

Thanks for reading,<br>
Brian ðŸ––ðŸ¤˜
