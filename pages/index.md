Christian. Husband. Father. Reader. Writer. Teacher. Programmer. Podcaster. **Brian** jug­gles many hats. When he’s not mix­ing metaphors, you might find him making lists, exploiting the power of three, or writ­ing in the third per­son.

**Melissa** is a house­wife by day, tak­ing care of a baby and keep­ing a house in or­der. By night, she’s a house­wife tak­ing care of a baby and keep­ing her house and hus­band in or­der. In the midst of all that, she still finds time to nerd over games, books, and TV shows.

**Lydia** is tired because she stayed up late reading a book under her covers last night.

**Amber** wants to grow up and have her own bakery.

**Penny** is into sloths, apples, and sloths named Apple.

**Susanna** might be the silliest Koser yet, an astounding feat.

**Verity** will stop crying to listen to most music, but especially The Turtle's "Happy Together".
