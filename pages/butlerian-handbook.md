> Do something every day that does not compute.
― Wendell Berry

This is not a list of virtues and vices. I'm not arguing that all the "less human" actions are bad; many of them I do, and plan to continue doing. But it's time to examine how we live with technology, and what is the aggregate result of all the small changes we've accepted.

- Watching a movie recommended by a friend is more human than watching a movie recommended by an algorithm.
- Meeting in person is more human than meeting virtually.
