This is not a list of virtues and vices. I'm not arguing that all the "less human" actions are bad; many of them I do, and plan to continue doing. 

It's not an argument for returning to a supposed Golden Age. We cannot go back the 1950s, the 1850s, or the 1350s, and should not if we could.

But it's time to examine how we live with technology. What is the aggregate result of all the small changes we've accepted? We cannot accept a priori every technological advancement as good. We may need to pump the brakes.
