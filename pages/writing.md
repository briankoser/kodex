## The Elements of Style
- 13. Make the paragraph the unit of composition (one topic)
- 14. Use active voice, but use passive for emphasis ("Pumpkins are not eaten in spring" vs "People don't eat pumpkins in spring")
- 17. Use definite, specific, concrete language
- 18. Avoid a succession of loose sentences (two clauses with a conjunction or relative like who or which)
- 20. Keep related words together
- 21. In summaries, keep to one tense
    - Summarize stories in present or past tense
    - Don't just summarize when reviewing literature. Write "an orderly discussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment".
    - Don't repeat "the author thinks", etc. State you are summarizing once.
- 22. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end
    - Or at the beginning, but a subject at the beginning is not automatically emphasized
    - Same for sentences in a paragraph and paragraphs in a composition
- A Few Matters of Form
    - Exclamation marks for exclamations, not simple statements
- Words and Expressions Commonly Misused
    - Aggravate: make a vexing thing more vexing (vex = irritate)
    - And/or: instead, "x or y or both"
    - As to whether → whether
    - As yet → yet
    - As being → being
    - Case: excise "in many cases" et. al.
    - Certainly: reduce use
    - Character: acts of a hostile character → hostile acts
    - Claim: "lay claim to", not declare, mention, or charge
    - Clever horse: good-natured, not ingenious
    - Compare to: resemblance outside a category
    - Compare with: difference within a category
    - Comprise: embrace; a zoo comprises animals, animals constitute a zoo
    - Contact: don't "contact" people; phone them, meet with them, etc.
    - Currently: usually redundant; can use precise language for emphasis ("at this moment")
    - >> Enormity: monstrous wickedness
    - Etc: don't use after "for example" because it means "and the rest"
    - Facility: hackneyed
    - Factor: hackneyed
    - Feature: hackneyed
    - Finalize: ambiguous
    - Flammable: use "inflammable" for "combustible"
    - Fortuitous: happening by chance, not lucky or fortunate
    - He is a man who → he
    - However: can start a sentence if it means "in any way", should not start when meaning "nevertheless"
    - Importantly → important (or rewrite)
    - "In regard to" (no S) but "as regards"
    - Insightful → perceptive
    - In terms of: avoid
    - "Like" governs nouns and pronouns; "As" introduces phrases and clauses
    - Meaningful: avoid
    - Nature: vague
    - Nice: use only for "precise" or "delicate"
    - Offputting: avoid (instead: objectionable, upsetting, disconcerting, distasteful)
    - Ongoing: avoid (instead: continuing, active)
    - One of the most: avoid
    - Partly vs Partially: physical amount vs degree (like farther and further)
    - People vs Public: the people vote, the public buys (people is political)
    - Personalize: pretentious
    - Personally: unnecessary
    - Presently: use to mean "soon" not "currently" to avoid confusion
    - So: avoid as intensifier
    - >> State: express fully or clearly
    - Student body → students
    - "That" is defining (tells which one). "Which" is undefining (add a fact).
    - The forseeable future: avoid
    - Thrust: use sparingly
    - Transpire: not "happen", but "became known"
    - Very: use sparingly
    - While: don't use in place of "and", "but", and "although". Use for "during the time that".
- Style
    - Place yourself in the background. Affect no style, keeping your mood and temper out. Style will emerge with competency.
    - Don't imitate consciously, but don't worry about consciously imitating.
    - Write with a plan. Form directs content.
    - Write with nouns and verbs. Adjectives and adverbs are assistants.
    - Don't overwrite.
    - Don't overstate: hype diminishes trust.
    - Avoid qualifiers: rather, very, little, pretty
    - Use explanatory verbs and adverbs sparingly in dialog. "They do this, apparently, in the belief that the word *said* is always in need of support, or because they have been told to do it by experts in the art of bad writing."
    - Don't share opinion if not requested.
    - Use similes and metaphors sparingly.

## Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury
- Write 1000-2000 words every day. Quantity precedes quality.
- Write with zest.
- Write about what you love or hate. Find a character and follow as fast as you can.
- Editing will be work, so enjoy the first draft.
- Make a list of evocative nouns for story prompts.
- Feed your muse with everything. Poetry that makes your arm hair stand up. Essays about everything from every time. Writing about the senses.
- Read authors who think like you and write the way you want to; read authors that don't.
- You learn from bad as well as good. Good quality can be mysterious; it's easy to pinpoint what not to do from bad.
- "The artist learns what to leave out."
- Don't plot ahead. Let your characters do.

Writing with short words is harder but better than writing with big words.
