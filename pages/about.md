Christian. Husband. Father. Reader. Writer. Programmer. Podcaster. **Brian** jug­gles many hats. When he’s not mix­ing metaphors, you might find him making lists, exploiting the power of three, or writ­ing in the third per­son.

**Melissa** is a house­wife by day, tak­ing care of a baby and keep­ing a house in or­der. By night, she’s a house­wife tak­ing care of a baby and keep­ing her house and hus­band in or­der. In the midst of all that, she still finds time to nerd over games, books, and TV shows.

**Lydia** is the oldest little girl in the house. She likes books, games, and everything purple. When she grows up she's going to be a doctor, a dentist, a barber, a baker, and a pilot.

Always keep an eye on **Amber**. She can make the best grumpy face in the business, and arguably the brightest smile.

**Penny** is the newest Koser (for now). She's into sloths, apples, and sloths named Apple.
