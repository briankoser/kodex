Hi, I'm Brian. This is where I, Melissa, Lydia, Amber, and Penny keep our digital stuff. Everything still looks the same, but behind the scenes I just put in place Version 3, which will let me quickly improve the site in ways we've planned for years.

We're going to start writing again: see everything on the [articles page](/articles).

The podcast is still at the newly-redesigned [Ten to One site](https://tto.koser.us), although soon you'll see new episodes pop up here as well.

Later,
Brian ðŸ––ðŸ¤˜
